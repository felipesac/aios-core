# designops-maturity-assessment

> Assess organization's DesignOps maturity level using Dave Malouf's Three Lenses framework and 5-level maturity model.

## Overview

This task provides a comprehensive assessment of an organization's DesignOps maturity across the Three Lenses: How We Work, How We Grow, How We Thrive. The output is a scored assessment with gap analysis and prioritized recommendations.

## Prerequisites

- Access to design team members for interviews/surveys
- Understanding of current organizational structure
- Stakeholder availability for context gathering

## Malouf Framework Reference

### Three Lenses of DesignOps
1. **How We Work** - Workflow, tools, processes, collaboration
2. **How We Grow** - Hiring, onboarding, career development, learning
3. **How We Thrive** - Culture, community, well-being, advocacy

### Maturity Levels
| Level | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Ad Hoc | No formal DesignOps - reactive and individual |
| 2 | Emerging | Basic standardization beginning - some awareness |
| 3 | Defined | Clear processes and standards - adoption growing |
| 4 | Managed | Metrics-driven optimization - continuous improvement |
| 5 | Optimized | Industry-leading - innovation and excellence |

## Task Steps

### Phase 1: Discovery (Diagnostic)

```yaml
step: 1
name: "Stakeholder Mapping"
actions:
  - Identify key stakeholders (design leadership, designers, cross-functional partners)
  - Schedule interviews or distribute surveys
  - Gather existing documentation (processes, tools, org charts)
questions:
  - "Who are the decision-makers for design operations?"
  - "What documentation exists about current processes?"
  - "Who can provide candid feedback about pain points?"
```

```yaml
step: 2
name: "Current State Discovery"
actions:
  - Interview 3-5 designers at different levels
  - Interview design leadership
  - Interview cross-functional partners (PM, Eng)
  - Review existing tools and processes
diagnostic_questions:
  how_we_work:
    - "What tools do you use for design? Is everyone using the same tools?"
    - "How do projects flow from brief to delivery?"
    - "How do design reviews happen? How often?"
    - "What's your handoff process to development?"
    - "Where do you store design assets?"
  how_we_grow:
    - "How were you hired? What was the interview process?"
    - "What was your onboarding experience like?"
    - "Is there a career ladder? Do you know how to progress?"
    - "What learning opportunities exist?"
  how_we_thrive:
    - "Do you feel part of a design community?"
    - "How is good work recognized?"
    - "How's your workload? Any burnout concerns?"
    - "Does design have influence on product decisions?"
```

### Phase 3: Gap Analysis

```yaml
step: 4
name: "Calculate Overall Maturity"
calculation: |
  OVERALL MATURITY = (How We Work + How We Grow + How We Thrive) / 3

  Interpretation:
  1.0 - 1.5 = Level 1 (Ad Hoc)
  1.6 - 2.5 = Level 2 (Emerging)
  2.6 - 3.5 = Level 3 (Defined)
  3.6 - 4.5 = Level 4 (Managed)
  4.6 - 5.0 = Level 5 (Optimized)
```

```yaml
step: 5
name: "Identify Gaps"
actions:
  - Compare current state to target state
  - Identify highest-impact gaps
  - Prioritize by effort vs impact
prioritization_matrix: |
  | Gap | Impact (1-5) | Effort (1-5) | Priority |
  |-----|--------------|--------------|----------|
  | [gap 1] | [X] | [Y] | [High/Med/Low] |
  | [gap 2] | [X] | [Y] | [High/Med/Low] |

  Priority Rule:
  - High Impact + Low Effort = Quick Win (do first)
  - High Impact + High Effort = Strategic (plan carefully)
  - Low Impact + Low Effort = Nice to have
  - Low Impact + High Effort = Avoid
```

### Phase 4: Recommendations

## Malouf Principles Applied

- **"Where is the friction? That's where we start."** - Focus diagnostic on pain points
- **"You can't skip maturity levels"** - Recommend incremental improvements only
- **"Measure before optimizing"** - Establish baselines before proposing changes
- **"Operations enable creativity"** - Frame recommendations as friction removal
- **"Three Lenses"** - Always assess all three dimensions

## Output Artifacts

1. **Maturity Assessment Report** (comprehensive document)
2. **Gap Analysis Matrix** (prioritized list)
3. **Roadmap** (quarterly plan)
4. **Success Metrics Dashboard** (tracking template)

## Next Steps After Assessment

- If maturity < 2: Focus on documenting current practices
- If maturity 2-3: Build formal processes and governance
- If maturity 3-4: Implement metrics and optimize
- If maturity > 4: Focus on innovation and industry leadership
