## Description

Plan lighting for on-location shoots where conditions are unpredictable and resources may be limited. Uses Joe McNally's field-proven techniques for integrating flash with available light, working in challenging spaces, and adapting to environmental constraints.

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of the location (or ability to scout)
- Portable lighting equipment (speedlights preferred)
- Trigger system for off-camera flash
- Knowledge of ambient light conditions

## Workflow

### Interactive Elicitation

1. **Location Assessment**
   - Indoor or outdoor?
   - Approximate space dimensions
   - Available power sources
   - Time of day for shoot
   - Weather conditions (if outdoor)

2. **Ambient Light Analysis**
   - Primary ambient sources (windows, overhead, mixed)
   - Color temperature of ambient (daylight, tungsten, fluorescent, mixed)
   - Ambient exposure estimate
   - Quality of ambient (harsh, soft, directional)

3. **Equipment Constraints**
   - What can you bring? (weight/size limits)
   - Power availability (battery only vs outlets)
   - Setup time available
   - Number of assistants (if any)

4. **Shot Requirements**
   - Type of shots needed
   - Number of subjects
   - Movement requirements
   - Final use of images

### Steps

1. **Scout or Visualize Location**
   - Identify available light sources
   - Find potential shooting positions
   - Note bounce surfaces (walls, ceilings)
   - Identify problem areas
   - Validation: Location understood

2. **Assess Ambient Light**
   - Meter ambient exposure
   - Identify color temperature(s)
   - Determine if ambient helps or hinders
   - Decide: use, suppress, or balance
   - Validation: Ambient strategy defined

3. **Plan Gear List**
   - Select lights (prioritize portability)
   - Choose essential modifiers only
   - Pack appropriate gels
   - Include backup batteries/units
   - Validation: Gear is portable and sufficient

4. **Design Primary Setup**
   - Key light position based on location constraints
   - Modifier selection for quality needs
   - Fill strategy (reflector, ambient, or second light)
   - Validation: Primary setup planned

5. **Plan Ambient Integration**
   - Determine flash-to-ambient ratio
   - Calculate shutter speed for ambient exposure
   - Plan gel matching if mixed lighting
   - Validation: Ambient and flash work together

6. **Prepare Backup Plans**
   - Alternative positions if primary fails
   - Simplified one-light fallback
   - Bounce-only emergency setup
   - Validation: Contingencies ready

7. **Document Location Setup**
   - Create setup diagram for location
   - Note specific positions relative to landmarks
   - Include ambient handling notes
   - Validation: Setup is reproducible

## Output

- **Location Lighting Plan**: Complete strategy
- **Gear Checklist**: Portable kit list
- **Ambient Integration Guide**: Flash/ambient balance
- **Backup Strategies**: Alternative approaches
- **Setup Diagram**: Position reference

## Location Lighting Techniques

### Drag Shutter
- Slow shutter captures ambient, flash freezes subject
- Great for: Events, environmental portraits
- Settings: Long shutter (1/30-1/8), flash for subject

### Overpower Ambient
- Flash dominates, ambient suppressed
- Great for: Harsh sun, ugly ambient, studio control
- Settings: Fast shutter (or HSS), high flash power

### Fill Flash
- Ambient is key, flash adds fill
- Great for: Backlit subjects, window light enhancement
- Settings: Expose for ambient, flash -1 to -2 stops

### Gel to Match
- Gel flash to match ambient color temperature
- Great for: Mixed lighting environments
- Process: Identify ambient color, gel flash to match, set WB

### Bounce Location
- Use environment as modifier (walls, ceilings)
- Great for: Small spaces, natural look
- Advantage: Turns room into giant softbox

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Location constraints addressed
- [ ] Ambient integration strategy clear
- [ ] Gear list is portable and sufficient
- [ ] Primary setup defined with backup
- [ ] Flash/ambient ratio specified
- [ ] Gel requirements identified
- [ ] On-location workflow documented

## Error Handling

- **Unexpected ambient**: Re-meter and adjust strategy
- **Space smaller than expected**: Use bounce, closer modifiers
- **Mixed color temperature**: Gel to dominant source
- **Power unavailable**: Confirm battery supply, reduce power usage
- **Wind (outdoor)**: Weight stands, use smaller modifiers

## McNally Principles Applied

- "Every location is a puzzle. Light is how you solve it."
- "The ambient is your canvas. Flash is your paint."
- "Gaffer tape fixes everything."
- "Scout the location with your eyes, not just your camera."
- "The best light is often the one you didn't plan."

## Examples

### Example 1: Corporate Office

```bash
*location-light "office conference room, large windows, mixed fluorescent"
```

### Example 2: Outdoor Event

```bash
*location-light "outdoor wedding reception, dusk, large tents"
```

### Example 3: Small Venue

```bash
*location-light "small restaurant, tungsten ambient, low ceilings"
```

## Notes

- Location work requires adaptability above all
- Always have a one-light backup plan
- Speedlights excel in location work due to portability
- Gels are essential for mixed lighting environments
- The room itself is often your best modifier
- "I've lit in airplane bathrooms, closets, and elevators" - Joe McNally
