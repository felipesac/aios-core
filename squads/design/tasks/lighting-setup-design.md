# Lighting Setup Design

> Task ID: mcnally-lighting-setup-design
> Agent: Joe McNally (Photography Lighting Expert)
> Version: 1.0.0

## Description

Design a complete lighting setup for specific shot requirements. Uses Joe McNally's "Big Three" framework (Direction, Quality, Color) and Layered Lighting Approach to create professional lighting diagrams with full technical specifications.

## Prerequisites

- Clear understanding of the shot objective (portrait, product, editorial, etc.)
- Knowledge of available equipment
- Information about location/space constraints
- Desired mood/aesthetic outcome

## Workflow

### Interactive Elicitation

This task uses interactive elicitation to understand requirements.

1. **Define Shot Objective**
   - What are you photographing? (portrait, product, editorial, event)
   - What story should the light tell?
   - What emotion should the viewer feel?

2. **Assess Available Equipment**
   - Light sources (speedlights, strobes, continuous)
   - Modifiers (softboxes, umbrellas, reflectors, grids)
   - Triggers and stands
   - Gels available

3. **Understand Environment**
   - Indoor or outdoor?
   - Space dimensions (approximate)
   - Ambient light conditions
   - Available surfaces for bounce

4. **Define Aesthetic**
   - Dramatic or soft?
   - High contrast or low contrast?
   - Color temperature preference
   - Reference images (if available)

### Steps

1. **Analyze Requirements**
   - Map shot objective to lighting approach
   - Identify primary storytelling elements
   - Determine key light pattern needed
   - Validation: Clear creative direction established

2. **Apply The Big Three Framework**
   - DIRECTION: Determine optimal angle (horizontal and vertical)
   - QUALITY: Select appropriate modifier for desired softness
   - COLOR: Define temperature and any gel requirements
   - Validation: All three variables specified

3. **Build Layered Lighting Plan**
   - Layer 0: Assess ambient contribution
   - Layer 1: Design key light (always first)
   - Layer 2: Determine fill requirement (if any)
   - Layer 3: Add separation light (if needed)
   - Layer 4: Plan background illumination (if needed)
   - Layer 5: Consider accent lights (sparingly)
   - Validation: Each layer has clear purpose

4. **Calculate Technical Specifications**
   - Estimate power settings
   - Define distances (light to subject, subject to background)
   - Specify modifier sizes
   - Calculate approximate ratios (key:fill)
   - Validation: All measurements documented

5. **Generate Lighting Diagram**
   - Create bird's-eye view diagram
   - Include all light positions with symbols
   - Show camera position
   - Note distances and angles
   - Add power settings and gels
   - Validation: Diagram is replicable

6. **Document Camera Settings**
   - Suggest ISO starting point
   - Recommend aperture for desired DOF
   - Calculate sync-safe shutter speed
   - Note white balance setting
   - Validation: Settings are consistent with setup

7. **Prepare Troubleshooting Guide**
   - Anticipate common issues
   - Provide adjustment suggestions
   - List backup approaches
   - Validation: Contingencies documented

## Output

- **Lighting Diagram**: Visual representation of setup
- **Equipment List**: All gear needed with specifications
- **Technical Settings**: Camera and flash settings
- **Setup Instructions**: Step-by-step positioning guide
- **Troubleshooting Notes**: Common issues and fixes

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Big Three (Direction, Quality, Color) fully specified
- [ ] Diagram is clear and replicable
- [ ] Each light has specific purpose documented
- [ ] Power settings and distances provided
- [ ] Camera settings match lighting plan
- [ ] Setup sequence is logical
- [ ] Troubleshooting guidance included

## Error Handling

- **Insufficient equipment**: Suggest alternatives, simplify to one light
- **Space too small**: Provide bounce techniques, close-modifier approaches
- **Mixed ambient**: Offer gel matching or ambient suppression strategies
- **Unclear objective**: Ask clarifying questions about mood and story

## McNally Principles Applied

- "Start with one light. Get it right before adding more."
- "The ambient is your canvas. Flash is your paint."
- "Direction, Quality, Color - master these three and you master light."
- "If you can't diagram it, you don't truly understand it."

## Examples

### Example 1: Corporate Headshot

```bash
*light-plan "corporate headshot, neutral background, professional but approachable"
```

### Example 2: Dramatic Portrait

```bash
*light-plan "dramatic portrait, Rembrandt style, masculine subject"
```

### Example 3: Event Photography

```bash
*light-plan "wedding reception, low ambient, need to work fast"
```

## Notes

- Always build lighting in layers, starting with key light
- Document everything for future replication
- Simpler setups are often more effective than complex ones
- The right modifier depends on distance, not just size
- Ambient light is a tool, not an obstacle
- "Light is the language of photography" - Joe McNally
