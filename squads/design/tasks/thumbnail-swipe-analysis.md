> Task ID: paddy-thumbnail-swipe-analysis
> Agent: Paddy Galloway (YouTube Thumbnail Strategist)
> Version: 1.0.0

## Description

Systematically analyze top-performing thumbnails in a specific niche to extract winning patterns, differentiation opportunities, and actionable insights. Uses the Competitor Swipe Framework to learn from channels that have already tested thousands of thumbnails.

**Core Principle:** "Don't reinvent the wheel. Study what's working, then make it yours."

## Prerequisites

- Defined niche/category to analyze
- Access to YouTube (for viewing thumbnails and performance proxies)
- Spreadsheet or note-taking system for documentation
- Time to analyze 20-50 thumbnails systematically

## Workflow

### Interactive Elicitation

1. **Define Analysis Scope**
   - What niche/category are you analyzing?
   - How many channels should we study? (recommend 5-10)
   - What subscriber range? (recommend mix of sizes)
   - Focus on recent videos only? (recommend last 6 months)

2. **Identify Performance Proxies**
   - Can you access CTR data? (only for your own channel)
   - Using views vs channel average as proxy?
   - Filtering for breakout videos (2x+ channel average)?

3. **Define Your Position**
   - What's your channel's current size?
   - What differentiates your content?
   - What aspects can you realistically execute?

### Steps

1. **Identify Top Channels in Niche**

   **Selection Criteria:**
   - Subscriber count: Mix of sizes (100K, 500K, 1M+)
   - Upload frequency: Active channels (uploads in last month)
   - Content alignment: Similar topics/format to your channel
   - Performance: Evidence of growing/successful

   **Channel List Template:**
   ```
   | Channel | Subs | Avg Views | Upload Freq | Why Included |
   |---------|------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
   ```

   **Recommended Mix:**
   - 2-3 channels your size (realistic comparison)
   - 3-4 channels 2-5x your size (aspiration)
   - 2-3 channels 10x+ your size (top tier patterns)

   - Validation: 5-10 channels identified

2. **Select High-Performance Videos**

   **Selection Method:**
   - For each channel, identify average view count
   - Select videos with 2x+ average views
   - Focus on last 6 months (recent patterns)
   - Include 3-5 videos per channel

   **Performance Proxy Calculation:**
   ```
   Channel Average = Total views / Total videos (last 20)
   Breakout Video = Views > 2x Channel Average
   ```

   **Video Selection Template:**
   ```
   | Channel | Video Title | Views | Ch Avg | Ratio |
   |---------|-------------|-------|--------|-------|
   ```

   - Validation: 20-50 high-performing videos identified

3. **Extract Thumbnail Elements**

   **For Each Thumbnail, Document:**

   **Visual Elements:**
   - Face present? (yes/no)
   - Expression type (surpresa, curiosidade, etc.)
   - Eye direction (camera, object, off-screen)
   - Face size (% of frame)
   - Face position (center, thirds)

   **Text Elements:**
   - Text present? (yes/no)
   - Word count
   - Text type (number, question, statement)
   - Exact words used
   - Font style (bold, thin, etc.)
   - Text position

   **Color Elements:**
   - Dominant color
   - Secondary color
   - Accent color
   - Contrast level (high/medium/low)
   - Background type (solid, gradient, photo)

   **Composition:**
   - Layout type (centered, rule of thirds)
   - Focal point location
   - Negative space usage
   - Additional elements (arrows, shapes, icons)

   **Curiosity Elements:**
   - What creates curiosity?
   - Information gap present?
   - Question implied?
   - Before/after implied?

   - Validation: All elements documented per thumbnail

4. **Identify Pattern Clusters**

   **Quantify Patterns:**

   ```
   FACE PATTERNS:
   - With face: N/total (X%)
   - Without face: N/total (X%)
   - Expression breakdown: [list]

   TEXT PATTERNS:
   - With text: N/total (X%)
   - Avg word count: X
   - Most common text types: [list]

   COLOR PATTERNS:
   - Most common primary: [color] (X%)
   - Most common combo: [combo] (X%)

   COMPOSITION PATTERNS:
   - Most common layout: [type] (X%)
   ```

   **Pattern Significance:**
   - Pattern in >70% = Strong signal, consider adopting
   - Pattern in 40-70% = Common, test both options
   - Pattern in <40% = Variable, opportunity to differentiate

   - Validation: Pattern frequencies calculated

5. **Document Top 20% vs Bottom 20%**

   **Top 20% (Highest Performance):**
   - What elements appear consistently?
   - What emotions dominate?
   - What makes these stand out?

   **Bottom 20% (Lower Performance):**
   - What elements appear here but NOT in top?
   - What patterns to AVOID?
   - What mistakes are common?

   **Contrast Analysis:**
   ```
   | Element | Top 20% | Bottom 20% | Insight |
   |---------|---------|------------|---------|
   | Face | 90% | 60% | Face = higher CTR |
   | Expression | Surpresa | Sorriso | Extremes win |
   | Text | <3 words | >4 words | Less is more |
   ```

   - Validation: Top vs bottom patterns documented

6. **Identify Differentiation Opportunities**

   **Underused Elements:**
   - Colors not commonly used in niche
   - Compositions rarely seen
   - Emotions underexplored
   - Text approaches unique

   **Differentiation Strategy:**
   ```
   Niche uses a lot of: [pattern]
   Opportunity to stand out: [different approach]
   Risk level: [low/medium/high]
   Test priority: [P0/P1/P2]
   ```

   **Examples:**
   - "Niche uses a lot of blue -> Test yellow/orange"
   - "Everyone uses close-up face -> Test wide shot"
   - "Most use 3+ words -> Test no text"

   - Validation: 3-5 differentiation opportunities identified

7. **Create Swipe File**

   **Swipe File Format:**
   ```yaml
   thumbnail_id: "[Channel] - [Video Title]"
   performance:
     views: "X"
     channel_average: "Y"
     ratio: "X/Y"
   elements:
     face: "yes/no"
     expression: "[type]"
     eye_direction: "[direction]"
     text: "[exact text or 'none']"
     colors: "[primary], [secondary]"
     composition: "[description]"
     curiosity_element: "[what creates gap]"
   why_it_works: "[hypothesis]"
   applicable_to_me: "[how to adapt]"
   ```

   **Organize Swipe File By:**
   - Emotion category
   - Content type
   - With/without face
   - CTR tier

   - Validation: Swipe file organized and accessible

8. **Generate Actionable Insights**

   **Pattern Adoption Recommendations:**
   ```
   ADOPT (>70% of top performers use):
   - [Pattern 1]: [how to implement]
   - [Pattern 2]: [how to implement]

   TEST (40-70%, results vary):
   - [Pattern 3]: [A/B test approach]
   - [Pattern 4]: [A/B test approach]

   AVOID (common in bottom performers):
   - [Pattern 5]: [why to avoid]
   - [Pattern 6]: [why to avoid]

   DIFFERENTIATE (underused opportunities):
   - [Pattern 7]: [differentiation approach]
   - [Pattern 8]: [differentiation approach]
   ```

   - Validation: Clear action items documented

9. **Create Concept Templates**

   **Based on Swipe Analysis, Create:**

   **Template 1: [Niche Standard]**
   - Based on most common winning patterns
   - Low risk, proven to work
   - Use for: safe uploads, testing new topics

   **Template 2: [Emotion Variant]**
   - Based on top emotion performers
   - Higher risk, higher reward
   - Use for: opinion/reaction content

   **Template 3: [Differentiation]**
   - Based on underused patterns
   - Test to discover new edges
   - Use for: 1 in 5 uploads to test

   - Validation: 3+ templates derived from analysis

10. **Schedule Re-Analysis**

    **Niche Evolution:**
    - Thumbnail trends change
    - New competitors emerge
    - Algorithm preferences shift

    **Re-Analysis Cadence:**
    - Full analysis: Quarterly
    - Quick check: Monthly

## Success Criteria

- [ ] 5-10 channels identified and documented
- [ ] 20-50 high-performance thumbnails analyzed
- [ ] All elements extracted per thumbnail
- [ ] Pattern frequencies quantified
- [ ] Top 20% vs bottom 20% contrasted
- [ ] 3-5 differentiation opportunities found
- [ ] Swipe file organized and accessible
- [ ] Actionable recommendations documented
- [ ] 3+ templates derived from findings

## Error Handling

- **Not enough high-performers to analyze**: Expand date range or include more channels
- **Patterns too varied**: Segment by content type within niche
- **No clear differentiation opportunities**: Focus on execution quality over uniqueness
- **Competitor thumbnails unavailable**: Use Wayback Machine or screenshot archives

## Security Considerations

- Analyze for learning, not copying exactly
- Add your unique twist to borrowed patterns
- Document sources for future reference
- Copying exactly = invisible in feed (bad)

## Examples

### Example 1: Tech Review Niche

**Key Findings:**
- 85% use product as focal point
- Face in 70%, usually showing reaction to product
- Text: product name + verdict word ("WORTH IT?", "ERRO")
- Colors: Black backgrounds, neon accents (green, blue)

**Differentiation:**
- Use warm colors (orange, red) instead of neon
- Try face-dominant with product smaller
- Test no text (product only)

### Example 2: Personal Finance Niche

**Key Findings:**
- 95% use face with money/growth imagery
- Numbers in 80% of top performers
- Green dominant (money association)
- Curiosidade + Aspiracao most common emotions

**Differentiation:**
- Use red/urgency for "mistake" videos
- Try infographic style (no face)
- Test controversia emotion (underused)

## Notes

- "Study your competitors' top 20%. They've already tested thousands of thumbnails for you."
- Copy pattern + unique twist = winning strategy
- Copying exactly makes you invisible
- Patterns change over time - quarterly re-analysis required
- What works at 1M subs may not work at 100K (audience difference)
