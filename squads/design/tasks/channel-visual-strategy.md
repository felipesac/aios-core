> Agent: Paddy Galloway (YouTube Thumbnail Strategist)
> Version: 1.0.0

## Description

Develop a cohesive visual identity strategy for YouTube channel thumbnails that balances brand consistency with CTR optimization. Creates thumbnail templates, style guidelines, and visual patterns that make the channel recognizable while maximizing clicks.

**Core Principle:** "Your thumbnail is a promise. Make sure your video delivers."

## Prerequisites

- Clear understanding of channel niche and target audience
- 5+ published videos (to analyze what's working)
- Access to existing thumbnails and CTR data
- Brand assets if available (colors, fonts, logo)

## Workflow

### Interactive Elicitation

1. **Gather Channel Context**
   - What is the channel name and niche?
   - Who is the primary audience (demographics, interests)?
   - What makes this channel unique vs competitors?
   - What is the channel's personality (serious, fun, educational, entertaining)?

2. **Identify Visual Anchors**
   - Does the host/creator appear in videos?
   - Are there recurring elements (studio, backdrop, props)?
   - Existing brand colors or logo?
   - Content format (talking head, tutorials, vlogs, reviews)?

3. **Define Goals**
   - Build brand recognition?
   - Maximize CTR on every video?
   - Stand out from competitors?
   - All of the above (balance)?

### Steps

1. **Analyze Niche Visual Landscape**

   **Competitor Swipe Analysis:**
   - Identify 5-10 top channels in niche
   - Document their thumbnail patterns:
     - Color schemes used
     - Face presence/style
     - Text usage patterns
     - Composition approaches

   **Pattern Map:**
   ```
   | Channel | Dominant Color | Face Style | Text Style | CTR Proxy |
   |---------|---------------|------------|------------|-----------|
   ```

   **Differentiation Opportunities:**
   - What colors are UNDERUSED in niche?
   - What emotions are UNDERUSED?
   - What composition is UNDERUSED?

   - Validation: Competitor analysis complete

2. **Define Channel Visual DNA**

   **Brand Personality Spectrum:**
   ```
   Serious ←────────────→ Playful
   Minimal ←────────────→ Maximal
   Corporate ←────────────→ Personal
   Calm ←────────────→ Energetic
   ```

   **Visual DNA Elements:**
   - Primary brand color
   - Secondary/accent color
   - Typography style
   - Face/no-face default
   - Compositional structure
   - Signature element (if any)

   - Validation: Visual DNA documented

3. **Design Thumbnail Template System**

   **Template Categories:**

   **Template A - Face Forward**
   - Host face prominent (40-50% of frame)
   - Expression: varies by video emotion
   - Text: minimal (0-3 words)
   - Background: consistent color or blur
   - Best for: opinions, personal stories, reactions

   **Template B - Object Focus**
   - Product/object central
   - Host face smaller (20-30%) or absent
   - Text: product name or key spec
   - Background: clean, high contrast
   - Best for: reviews, unboxings, tutorials

   **Template C - Before/After**
   - Split composition
   - Clear transformation visual
   - Text: numbers or outcome
   - Consistent divider style
   - Best for: tutorials, transformations, comparisons

   **Template D - Bold Statement**
   - Text-dominant
   - Minimal imagery
   - High contrast colors
   - Best for: controversial takes, news, lists

   - Validation: 3-4 templates designed

4. **Establish Color System**

   **Primary Palette:**
   - Primary: [Color] - used in 60% of elements
   - Secondary: [Color] - used in 30% of elements
   - Accent: [Color] - used in 10% for emphasis

   **Contrast Requirements:**
   - Text on background: WCAG AA minimum (4.5:1)
   - Tested in YouTube dark mode
   - Tested in YouTube light mode
   - Tested at mobile thumbnail size (160x90)

   **Color Psychology Alignment:**
   ```
   Channel vibe: [energetic/calm/authoritative/friendly]
   Primary color supports: [emotion it evokes]
   Differentiates from competitors: [how]
   ```

   - Validation: Color system tested for contrast

5. **Define Typography Guidelines**

   **Font Selection:**
   - Primary font: [Bold sans-serif for headlines]
   - Weight: Bold or Extra Bold only
   - No thin fonts, no serifs (illegible at small size)

   **Recommended Fonts:**
   - Impact (classic, high impact)
   - Bebas Neue (modern, clean)
   - Anton (bold, compressed)
   - Montserrat Bold (versatile)

   **Text Hierarchy:**
   - Maximum: 3 words
   - Size: 15-25% of thumbnail height
   - Position: Top or bottom third
   - Contrast: Always stroke/shadow for legibility

   **Text Templates:**
   ```
   Numbers: "$1M" "30 DIAS" "100%"
   Questions: "COMO?" "POR QUE?"
   Statements: "ERRO" "NAO" "SIM"
   ```

   - Validation: Typography tested at mobile size

6. **Create Face Expression Library**

   **Expression Categories:**
   - Curiosidade: Eyebrow raised, slight smirk, questioning
   - Surpresa/Choque: Eyes wide, mouth open, dramatic
   - Determinacao: Jaw set, eyes focused, confident
   - Controversia: Frown, skeptical, challenging
   - Aspiracao: Satisfied, proud, accomplished

   **Photo Session Guidelines:**
   - Capture 5-10 variations of each expression
   - Consistent lighting setup
   - Consistent camera angle/distance
   - High resolution for cropping flexibility
   - Multiple outfit options if needed

   **Eye Direction Library:**
   - Direct to camera (connection)
   - Looking at object position (direction)
   - Looking off-camera (mystery)

   - Validation: Expression library shot list created

7. **Design Signature Element (Optional)**

   **Types of Signature Elements:**
   - Consistent corner badge
   - Recurring graphic element
   - Distinctive border style
   - Logo placement pattern
   - Color bar or stripe

   **Rules for Signature Element:**
   - Small enough to not distract
   - Consistent placement across thumbnails
   - Doesn't reduce CTR (test it)
   - Builds recognition over time

   **Warning:**
   - Never sacrifice CTR for "brand consistency"
   - Test with and without signature element
   - Some channels don't need one

   - Validation: Signature element designed or deliberately omitted

8. **Create Style Guide Document**

   **Style Guide Contents:**
   1. Channel Visual DNA summary
   2. Color palette with hex codes
   3. Typography specifications
   4. Template library (with examples)
   5. Expression library reference
   6. Do's and Don'ts
   7. Quick reference card

   **Do's:**
   - Use templates as starting point
   - Prioritize CTR over consistency
   - Test variants even with established templates
   - Update style guide based on data

   **Don'ts:**
   - Sacrifice clicks for aesthetics
   - Make all thumbnails look identical
   - Ignore CTR data because "it's on brand"
   - Use templates without testing

   - Validation: Style guide document complete

9. **Plan Implementation Rollout**

   **Phase 1 - Test (2-4 weeks):**
   - Apply new system to 3-5 videos
   - Test against old style if possible
   - Measure CTR changes

   **Phase 2 - Refine (2-4 weeks):**
   - Adjust based on data
   - Document what's working/not
   - Update style guide

   **Phase 3 - Scale (ongoing):**
   - Apply to all new uploads
   - Consider updating high-impression old videos
   - Quarterly review and adjustment

   - Validation: Implementation timeline defined

10. **Define Success Metrics**

    **Brand Recognition Metrics:**
    - Returning viewer rate increase
    - Comments mentioning visual style
    - Recognition in blind tests

    **CTR Metrics:**
    - Average CTR vs pre-strategy baseline
    - CTR consistency (less variance)
    - Top performer CTR maintained or improved

    **Efficiency Metrics:**
    - Time to create thumbnail (should decrease)
    - Number of variants needed (may decrease)
    - Team consistency (if multiple creators)

    - Validation: Success metrics defined

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Competitor landscape analyzed
- [ ] Visual DNA clearly defined
- [ ] 3-4 templates designed
- [ ] Color system tested for contrast
- [ ] Typography guidelines established
- [ ] Expression library planned
- [ ] Style guide document complete
- [ ] Implementation plan timeline
- [ ] Success metrics defined

## Error Handling

- **No clear competitor patterns**: Define unique style, test aggressively
- **Brand colors have low contrast**: Adjust for thumbnails, keep brand elsewhere
- **Templates feel too restrictive**: Build flexibility into templates
- **CTR drops with new system**: Rollback, analyze what's not working

## Security Considerations

- Brand consistency should NEVER override CTR
- Test everything, even "obviously good" brand decisions
- Be willing to break your own rules if data says so
- Document decisions for future reference

## Examples

### Example 1: Educational Channel

**Visual DNA:**
- Personality: Serious but approachable
- Primary: Navy blue (authority)
- Secondary: White (clarity)
- Accent: Yellow (attention)
- Face default: Yes, expressions vary
- Text default: 2-3 words, questions or numbers

### Example 2: Entertainment Channel

**Visual DNA:**
- Personality: High energy, playful
- Primary: Bright red (energy)
- Secondary: Black (contrast)
- Accent: Electric blue (surprise)
- Face default: Yes, extreme expressions
- Text default: 0-2 words, reactions/numbers

## Notes

- "Thumbnail and title are ONE system. They complement, they don't repeat."
- Consistency helps recognition, but CTR pays the bills
- Even MrBeast breaks his own thumbnail "rules" when data says to
- Quarterly review prevents style stagnation
- Great templates make creation faster AND better
