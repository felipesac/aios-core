### 5. ROI Justification (The Business Case)

Make the math obvious:

```markdown
## Return on Investment

**Your Investment:** $[Price of recommended option]
**Annual Value Created:** $[Calculated value]
**ROI:** [Value/Price]x return
**Payback Period:** [Price/(Value/12)] months

### 3-Year Projection

| Year | Investment | Value Created | Cumulative ROI |
|------|------------|---------------|----------------|
| 1    | $[Price]   | $[Value]      | [X]x           |
| 2    | $0         | $[Value]      | [X]x           |
| 3    | $0         | $[Value]      | [X]x           |
| Total| $[Price]   | $[Value×3]    | [X]x           |

Net 3-Year Benefit: $[Value×3 - Price]
```
