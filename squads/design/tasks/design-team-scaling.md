# design-team-scaling

> Plan design team growth and structure using Dave Malouf's scaling framework and team topology principles.

## Overview

This task guides strategic planning for scaling a design team from current state to target size. It emphasizes building systems before adding headcount, following Malouf's principle: "Scale through systems, not just headcount."

## Prerequisites

- Completed `designops-maturity-assessment.md` (know your current maturity)
- Understanding of business growth plans
- Budget parameters (rough estimates acceptable)
- Timeline expectations

## Malouf Framework Reference

### Scaling Phases
| Phase | Size | Name | Key Focus |
|-------|------|------|-----------|
| 1 | 0-5 | Founding | Establish credibility, first wins |
| 2 | 5-15 | Building | Standardize, build foundations |
| 3 | 15-50 | Scaling | Scale processes, build management |
| 4 | 50-150 | Optimizing | Efficiency, centers of excellence |
| 5 | 150+ | Enterprise | Multi-BU coordination, global |

### Team Topologies
| Topology | Description | Best For |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Centralized | All designers in one team | <20 designers, consistency priority |
| Embedded | Designers sit in product teams | Speed priority, deep product knowledge |
| Federated | Embedded with dotted line to design | 50+ designers, balance consistency/speed |
| Hybrid | Mix based on function | Large, complex orgs, specialized needs |

### Scaling Principles
1. Systems before headcount
2. Hire one level ahead
3. Document before scaling
4. Measure what matters
5. Culture is fragile at scale
6. Governance enables, not restricts

## Task Steps

### Phase 1: Current State Assessment

```yaml
step: 1
name: "Assess Current State"
questions:
  headcount:
    - "How many designers currently?"
    - "What's the breakdown by role/level?"
    - "What's the designer-to-engineer ratio?"
    - "What's the designer-to-PM ratio?"
  maturity:
    - "What's your DesignOps maturity level?"
    - "What processes are documented?"
    - "What's working well?"
    - "What's breaking?"
  structure:
    - "Current topology (centralized/embedded/etc)?"
    - "Reporting structure?"
    - "Who manages designers?"
output: |
  CURRENT STATE SNAPSHOT

  Headcount: [X] designers
  Breakdown:
  - Senior: [X]
  - Mid: [X]
  - Junior: [X]
  - Specialists: [X] (research, systems, etc.)

  Ratios:
  - Designer:Engineer = 1:[X]
  - Designer:PM = 1:[X]

  Maturity Level: [X]/5
  Current Topology: [type]

  Strengths:
  - [list]

  Pain Points:
  - [list]
```

### Phase 2: Target State Definition

```yaml
step: 2
name: "Define Target State"
questions:
  growth:
    - "Target headcount in 6/12/18 months?"
    - "What's driving the growth?"
    - "What new capabilities are needed?"
  business_context:
    - "New products/markets?"
    - "Acquisition/merger planned?"
    - "Reorganization coming?"
  constraints:
    - "Budget constraints?"
    - "Hiring market conditions?"
    - "Timeline pressures?"
output: |
  TARGET STATE DEFINITION

  Timeline: [X] months
  Target Headcount: [Y] designers
  Growth Rate: [Z] designers/quarter

  New Capabilities Needed:
  - [list]

  Business Drivers:
  - [list]

  Constraints:
  - [list]
```

### Phase 3: Gap Analysis (Systems vs Headcount)

```yaml
step: 3
name: "Identify Systems Gaps"
principle: "Build the system before hiring - otherwise you're just adding chaos."
checklist:
  processes:
    - "[ ] Design workflow documented?"
    - "[ ] Handoff process defined?"
    - "[ ] Review process standardized?"
    - "[ ] Project intake established?"

    - "[ ] Standards documented?"
    - "[ ] Escalation paths defined?"
    - "[ ] Quality gates established?"
  metrics:
    - "[ ] Baseline metrics collected?"
    - "[ ] Success metrics defined?"
    - "[ ] Reporting cadence set?"
output: |
  SYSTEMS GAP ANALYSIS

## Malouf Principles Applied

- **"Scale through systems, not just headcount"** - Build foundation before hiring
- **"Document before you scale - tribal knowledge doesn't scale"** - Require documentation
- **"Culture is fragile at scale - intentionality is required"** - Plan culture preservation
- **"Hire one level ahead - your future self will thank you"** - Plan for growth
- **"The right structure depends on context"** - Customize topology recommendation

## Output Artifacts

1. **Current State Assessment** - Baseline documentation
2. **Target State Definition** - Growth goals
3. **Systems Gap Analysis** - Prerequisites before scaling
4. **Topology Recommendation** - Structure proposal
5. **Scaling Roadmap** - Phased plan
6. **Budget Estimate** - Investment and ROI

## Warning Signs During Scaling

Monitor these indicators that scaling is going wrong:

| Phase | Warning Sign | Action |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| Building | Quality inconsistent | Slow down, standardize |
| Scaling | Managers overwhelmed | Add management layer |
| Scaling | Communication breaking | Increase rituals |
| Optimizing | Innovation slowing | Reduce bureaucracy |
| Enterprise | Ivory tower forming | Increase autonomy |
