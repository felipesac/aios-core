## Description

Edit engaging B-roll sequences that enhance storytelling and maintain viewer attention. Peter McKinnon's approach to B-roll treats every shot as a frame in a cinematic story - purposeful, visually compelling, and rhythmically edited to music or narrative beats.

"B-roll isn't filler. B-roll is storytelling."

## Prerequisites

- B-roll footage imported into editing software (Premiere, Final Cut, DaVinci)
- Music track or narrative audio to edit against
- Understanding of the story/mood being supported
- Coffee recommended for long editing sessions

## Workflow

### Interactive Elicitation

1. **Define B-Roll Purpose**
   - What story is this B-roll supporting?
   - Mood: energetic, calm, dramatic, nostalgic?
   - Pace: fast cuts, slow contemplative, mixed?

2. **Select Color Grade Direction**
   - Match existing footage? (provide reference)
   - Cinematic look (teal/orange)?
   - Vintage/film look?
   - Clean/natural?

3. **Identify Technical Requirements**
   - Target frame rate (24fps cinematic, 30fps, 60fps)
   - Output resolution
   - Platform (YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, cinema)

### Steps

1. **Organize and Review Footage**
   - Import all B-roll into project
   - Create bins/folders by location or subject
   - Mark selects with in/out points
   - Rate best shots (5-star system)
   - Validation: Know what you have to work with

2. **Identify Story Beats**
   - Listen to music/audio track
   - Mark beat points on timeline
   - Identify crescendos, drops, transitions
   - Note energy changes
   - Validation: Understand the rhythm

3. **Create Rough Cut Assembly**
   - Place best shots on timeline
   - Align to major beat points
   - Don't worry about perfection yet
   - Focus on shot variety (wide, medium, close)
   - Validation: Basic structure in place

4. **Establish Visual Flow**
   - Check shot-to-shot continuity
   - Vary shot types (don't repeat angles)
   - Use movement direction consistency
   - Create visual patterns
   - Validation: Shots flow naturally

5. **Apply Speed Ramping (if appropriate)**
   - Identify moments for slow-mo impact
   - Smooth speed transitions (ease in/out)
   - 40-60% speed for dramatic effect
   - 100%+ for energy/urgency
   - Validation: Speed changes feel intentional

6. **Add Transitions**
   - Default: Hard cut (90% of transitions)
   - Cross dissolve: Time passing, dreamy moments
   - Whip pan/zoom: Energy, scene change
   - Match cut: Visual connection between shots
   - Validation: Transitions serve the story

7. **Apply Color Grade**
   - Create adjustment layer for global grade
   - Apply consistent LUT or color settings
   - Match to main footage if applicable
   - Individual shot correction as needed
   - Validation: Cohesive visual style

8. **Fine-Tune to Music**
   - Tighten cuts to exact beat points
   - Use J/L cuts for smoother audio
   - Sync action to rhythm
   - Leave breathing room on slow sections
   - Validation: Edit feels "musical"

9. **Add Polish Elements**
   - Subtle zoom/scale animation (1-5%)
   - Position animation for static shots
   - Film grain overlay (optional)
   - Letterboxing for cinematic feel
   - Validation: Professional polish added

10. **Review Full Sequence**
    - Watch at 100% (no scrubbing)
    - Note any jarring moments
    - Check pacing feels right
    - Verify color consistency
    - Validation: Sequence tells the story

## Output

- **Edited B-Roll Sequence**: Complete timeline ready for export
- **Color Grade Settings**: LUT or settings for consistency
- **Edit Notes**: Key decisions and timing references

## B-Roll Editing Principles

### The McKinnon Cut Philosophy

1. **Every Shot Has Purpose**
   - No filler shots
   - Each cut advances the story
   - If you can't explain why it's there, cut it

2. **Rhythm is Everything**
   - Edit to the music/audio
   - Vary pace for interest
   - Fast cuts = energy, slow cuts = emotion

3. **Shot Variety Creates Interest**
   - Wide establishes context
   - Medium shows action
   - Close reveals detail
   - Never repeat same angle back-to-back

4. **Movement Creates Energy**
   - Camera movement
   - Subject movement
   - Edit movement (pacing)

5. **Color Unifies**
   - Consistent grade = cohesive sequence
   - Grade sets mood
   - Bad color = amateur hour

### Speed Ramping Guide

| Effect | Speed | Use Case |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Dramatic slow-mo | 30-50% | Impact moments, reveals |
| Subtle slow | 60-80% | Smooth, contemplative |
| Real time | 100% | Normal action |
| Fast forward | 150-300% | Time compression, energy |
| Hyperlapse | 500%+ | Major time passage |

### Transition Decision Matrix

| Situation | Recommended Transition |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Same scene, different angle | Hard cut |
| Same scene, time passing | Cross dissolve (short) |
| Scene change, same mood | Hard cut |
| Scene change, mood shift | Cross dissolve or dip to black |
| Energy moment | Whip pan or hard cut on beat |
| Visual connection | Match cut |

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Every shot serves the story
- [ ] Cuts aligned to audio/music beats
- [ ] Shot variety maintained (no repeated angles)
- [ ] Color grade consistent throughout
- [ ] Pacing matches intended mood
- [ ] Speed ramping feels natural (if used)
- [ ] Sequence flows without jarring moments

## Error Handling

- **Sequence feels choppy**: Lengthen cuts, add breathing room
- **Sequence drags**: Tighten cuts, remove weak shots
- **Color doesn't match**: Check adjustment layer order, reset and redo
- **Audio sync off**: Check frame rate matches, realign

## Security Considerations

- Backup project file before major changes
- Keep original footage untouched
- Version save points during edit
- Export at highest quality, compress later

```bash
*b-roll-edit --mood cinematic

## Notes

- B-roll should enhance, never distract
- Cut to the beat, but don't be a slave to it
- When in doubt, use hard cuts
- Variety prevents boredom
- Color grade first, then fine-tune individual clips
- Watch the whole thing at 100% before calling it done
- "The camera captures what you see. The edit shows what you felt."
