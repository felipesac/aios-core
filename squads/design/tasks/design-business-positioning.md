## Metadata

```

## Purpose

Stop competing on price. Position yourself as the only logical choice for premium clients.

> "If you try to speak to everyone, you speak to no one."
> -- Chris Do

## The Positioning Problem

### Why Most Designers Struggle

- "I do logos, websites, branding, print, social media..."
- Competes with everyone
- No clear differentiator
- Forced to compete on price
- Attracts price-sensitive clients

### The Premium Alternative

- Specialist in specific problem/industry
- Competes with almost no one
- Clear expertise and authority
- Charges premium rates
- Attracts quality clients

> "Specialists get paid more than generalists."

## Win Without Pitching Framework

### The Pitch Problem

**What pitching is:** Free speculative work to "win" the project

**Why it's bad:**
- Devalues your work
- Attracts clients who don't respect process
- Selects by appearance, not expertise
- Wastes time on projects you won't close

**The alternative:** Compete on expertise and process, not free samples

### How to Decline Pitches

**Direct approach:**
```
"Thank you for the invitation. We don't participate in speculative
competitions. If you'd like to understand our process and see if
we're a fit, I'm happy to schedule a conversation."
```

**Redirect approach:**
```
"I understand that's your process. Let me explain why we do things
differently: Our best work comes from deeply understanding the
problem first. I can offer a paid diagnostic session that will
give you a real sample of our thinking and process."
```

**Qualification approach:**
```
"Yes, everyone does pitches. That's exactly why we don't. If you're
evaluating 5 agencies on the same pitch, you're choosing by
appearance, not expertise. Our differentiator is process and
strategic thinking, not speculative art."
```

## Phase 1: Define Your Niche

### The Narrowing Exercise

Answer these questions honestly:

1. **What do you enjoy most?**
   - Which projects energize you?
   - What work would you do for free?
   - Where does time disappear?

2. **What are you best at?**
   - Where do you get best results?
   - What do clients praise most?
   - Where is your track record strongest?

3. **What's profitable?**
   - Which projects have best margins?
   - Which clients pay fastest?
   - Which work leads to more work?

**Your niche lives at the intersection of all three.**

### Niche Formula

```

so they can expand into new markets with consistent recognition."
