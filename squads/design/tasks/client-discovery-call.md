```

## Purpose

Conduct effective discovery calls that diagnose the real problem before proposing solutions.

> "Be a doctor, not a waiter. Diagnose before you prescribe."
> -- Chris Do

## The Doctor vs Waiter Framework

### Waiter Behavior (AVOID)
- Takes the order as given
- Delivers exactly what's requested
- Becomes a commodity
- Competes on price

### Doctor Behavior (ADOPT)
- Asks about symptoms
- Makes proper diagnosis
- Prescribes appropriate treatment
- Commands respect and premium fees

**Key Insight:** Patient says "Give me aspirin." Doctor doesn't just hand over aspirin. Doctor asks "Where does it hurt?" Maybe aspirin isn't the solution.

## Pre-Call Preparation

### Research the Prospect (15 min)

- [ ] Company website - understand their business
- [ ] LinkedIn - decision maker background
- [ ] Recent news - any changes or announcements
- [ ] Competitors - market positioning
- [ ] Previous work - if they've done similar projects

### Prepare Your Questions (10 min)

Have your diagnosis questions ready but be flexible to follow the conversation.

### Set Up Environment

- [ ] Quiet space, no interruptions
- [ ] Good audio/video quality
- [ ] Note-taking system ready
- [ ] Timer visible (don't go over)
- [ ] Water nearby

## Discovery Call Structure (45-60 min)

### Opening (2-3 minutes)

```
"Thank you for making time today. Before I tell you about what I do,
I want to understand you first.

What brought you to reach out to me?"
```

**Rules:**
- Let them talk first
- Don't pitch yourself yet
- Show genuine curiosity
- Take notes on their words

### Level 1: Surface Questions (5-7 minutes)

**Purpose:** Understand what they THINK they need

```
- "What are you looking for?"
- "What outcome are you hoping for?"
- "What does success look like to you?"
- "Why are you exploring this now? What changed?"
```

**Listen for:** Symptoms vs. actual problems. They may be asking for aspirin when they need surgery.

### Level 2: Problem Questions (10-12 minutes)

**Purpose:** Understand the REAL problem

```
- "Tell me more about [the problem they mentioned]."
- "How long have you had this problem?"
- "What have you already tried to solve it?"
- "Why didn't those solutions work?"
- "Who else is affected by this problem?"
- "What happens if you don't solve this?"
```

**Technique:** Reflect back what you hear

```
"So what I'm hearing is [summary]. Is that right?"
```

### Level 3: Cost Questions (8-10 minutes)

**Purpose:** Quantify the problem in DOLLARS

```
- "How much is this problem costing you?"
- "What's the impact on revenue?"
- "How much time is being wasted?"
- "What opportunities are you missing because of this?"
- "If you don't fix this in the next 6 months, what happens?"
- "What's the cost of doing nothing?"
```

**Critical:** Get specific numbers. Don't accept vague answers.

```
BAD: "It's costing us a lot."
PROBE: "Help me understand 'a lot.' Are we talking thousands? Tens of thousands? Hundreds of thousands?"
```

### Level 4: Value Questions (5-7 minutes)

**Purpose:** Quantify the transformation value

```
- "If I could solve this completely, what would that be worth to you?"
- "What would change in your business if this problem was gone?"
- "How would you measure success?"
- "What ROI would make this a great investment?"
```

### Level 5: Commitment Questions (5-7 minutes)

**Purpose:** Verify decision-making capability

```
- "Who else needs to be involved in this decision?"
- "What's your decision-making process?"
- "What's your ideal timeline?"
- "Do you have budget allocated for this?"
- "What would prevent you from moving forward?"
```

**Red Flag Detection:**
- No budget: May not be qualified
- Many stakeholders: Longer sales cycle
- No timeline: May not be urgent
- "Just exploring": May not be serious

### Transition (3-5 minutes)

```
"Based on what you've shared with me, it sounds like [summary of problem]
is costing you approximately $[amount] per [time period].

I have some ideas about how I can help. Would it be helpful if I put
together some options for you to consider?"
```

### Close and Next Steps (3-5 minutes)

```
"Here's what I suggest as next steps:

1. I'll put together a proposal with options based on what we discussed
2. We'll schedule a call for [specific date/time] to review it together
3. You'll bring [other decision makers] to that call

Does that work?"
```

**Get commitment:**
- Specific date for follow-up
- All decision makers present
- Clear next action

## The 80/20 Rule

**You talk: 20%**
- Ask questions
- Reflect back
- Clarify

**They talk: 80%**
- Share their problems
- Reveal their pain
- Discover their own answers

> "The person who asks the questions controls the conversation."

## What NOT to Do

- [ ] **Don't pitch first** - No portfolio, no services, no "about us"
- [ ] **Don't accept their diagnosis** - They're not the expert
- [ ] **Don't talk more than 20%** - You're here to learn
- [ ] **Don't give prices on the call** - You need time to calculate value
- [ ] **Don't accept vague costs** - Push for specific numbers
- [ ] **Don't skip commitment questions** - Know who decides

## Handling Common Situations

### "Just tell me your price"

```
"I could give you a number, but it wouldn't be meaningful without
understanding your situation. The same project can be worth $5,000
or $50,000 depending on the problem it solves. Help me understand
your situation so I can give you something useful."
```

### "We're just exploring"

```
"I appreciate the honesty. What triggered the exploration?
Something must have changed."
```

### "We have a tight budget"

```
"I understand. Help me understand: what's the budget range you're
working with? That helps me know if I can help or if I should
recommend someone else."
```

### "Can you send me your portfolio?"

```
"I'd be happy to share relevant work. But I find it's more useful
to first understand what you're trying to accomplish, so I can
show you work that's actually relevant to your situation."
```
