> Task ID: brand-differentiation
> Agent: Marty Neumeier (Brand Strategy Pioneer)
> Version: 1.0.0

## Description

Apply Neumeier's "Zag" methodology to find radical differentiation for a brand. When everybody zigs, zag. This task systematically works through the 17-step Zag blueprint to identify unique positioning and create an "onlyness statement" that sets the brand apart from all competitors.

## Prerequisites

- Brand context (name, category, current positioning)
- Competitive landscape knowledge
- Target customer understanding
- Access to internal stakeholders for validation

## Workflow

### Interactive Elicitation

This task uses interactive elicitation to work through the 17 Zag checkpoints.

1. **Gather Brand Foundation**
   - Ask for brand name and category
   - Request current positioning (if any)
   - Identify business model and revenue drivers
   - Understand growth objectives

2. **Map Competitive Context**
   - List known competitors
   - Identify category conventions
   - Note what "everyone does"

3. **Confirm Scope**
   - Show differentiation plan
   - Confirm key stakeholders for validation
   - Begin Zag process

### Steps

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Checkpoints 1-5)

1. **Checkpoint 1: Who Are You?**
   - Define core business in simple terms
   - Test: Can a child understand your business?
   - Validation: Simple, clear business definition

2. **Checkpoint 2: What Business Are You REALLY In?**
   - Look beyond product to higher purpose
   - Example: Nike isn't in shoes. Nike is in human potential
   - Validation: Purpose-level definition articulated

3. **Checkpoint 3: What Is Your Vision?**
   - Define the future state you're creating
   - Test: Is it inspiring AND achievable?
   - Validation: Vision statement passes inspiration test

4. **Checkpoint 4: What Wave Are You Riding?**
   - Identify macro trends working in your favor
   - Test: Is the wave big enough to surf?
   - Validation: At least one powerful trend identified

5. **Checkpoint 5: Who Shares the Brandscape?**
   - Map all competitors and substitutes
   - Include indirect competitors
   - Test: Have you mapped the entire brandscape?
   - Validation: Complete competitive map created

#### Phase 2: Differentiation (Checkpoints 6-9)

6. **Checkpoint 6: What Makes You the ONLY?**
   - Create onlyness statement using formula
   - Formula: "Our [offering] is the ONLY [category] that [key differentiator]"
   - Test multiple variations
   - Validation: Onlyness statement drafted

7. **Checkpoint 7: What Should You Add or Subtract?**
   - Audit features - add differentiators, remove commodities
   - Test: Does every feature reinforce your onlyness?
   - Validation: Feature audit complete with recommendations

8. **Checkpoint 8: Who Loves You?**
   - Identify true believers (your tribe)
   - Test: Can you name 10 passionate customers?
   - Validation: Tribe defined with characteristics

9. **Checkpoint 9: Who Is Your Enemy?**
   - Define what you stand against
   - Example: Apple's enemy: complexity. Nike's enemy: inactivity
   - Validation: Clear enemy articulated

#### Phase 3: Communication (Checkpoints 10-14)

10. **Checkpoint 10: What Do They Call You?**
    - Evaluate if name supports differentiation
    - Test: Does name help or hurt your zag?
    - Validation: Name assessment complete

11. **Checkpoint 11: How Do You Explain Yourself?**
    - Create trueline (single sentence essence)
    - Test: Can you say it in one breath?
    - Validation: Trueline crafted and tested

12. **Checkpoint 12: How Do You Spread the Word?**
    - Define communication strategy
    - Test: Is message simple enough to spread?
    - Validation: Communication approach documented

13. **Checkpoint 13: How Do People Engage With You?**
    - Map every customer touchpoint
    - Test: Does each touchpoint reinforce your zag?
    - Validation: Touchpoint map complete

14. **Checkpoint 14: What Do They Experience?**
    - Design coherent experience at each touchpoint
    - Test: Is experience consistent with brand promise?
    - Validation: Experience design documented

#### Phase 4: Growth (Checkpoints 15-17)

15. **Checkpoint 15: How Do You Earn Their Loyalty?**
    - Design retention and advocacy strategy
    - Test: Do customers become evangelists?
    - Validation: Loyalty strategy defined

16. **Checkpoint 16: How Do You Extend Your Success?**
    - Plan brand extensions and growth
    - Test: Will extensions strengthen or dilute your zag?
    - Validation: Extension strategy assessed

17. **Checkpoint 17: How Do You Protect Your Portfolio?**
    - Create brand architecture and guidelines
    - Test: Is your brand portfolio coherent?
    - Validation: Protection strategy defined

#### Final Phase: Validation

18. **Zag Test**
    - Validate differentiation against criteria:
      - Differentiated: Radically different from competitors
      - Focused: Narrowly targeted
      - Relevant: Matters to customers
      - Memorable: Easy to recall
      - Extendable: Can grow over time
    - Validation: All criteria pass

19. **Onlyness Validation**
    - Test onlyness statement:
      - Is it TRUE? Can you prove it?
      - Is it RELEVANT? Do customers care?
      - Is it DEFENSIBLE? Can competitors copy it?
      - Is it MOTIVATING? Does it inspire action?
    - Validation: All tests pass

20. **Generate Zag Report**
    - Compile all checkpoint findings
    - Document final onlyness statement
    - Create implementation roadmap
    - Validation: Report complete

## Output

- **zag-analysis.md**: Complete 17-checkpoint analysis
- **onlyness-statement.md**: Validated differentiation statement
- **brandscape-map.yaml**: Competitive positioning map
- **zag-implementation.md**: Roadmap for executing differentiation

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All 17 checkpoints completed with findings
- [ ] Onlyness statement crafted and validated
- [ ] Brandscape fully mapped (direct + indirect)
- [ ] Tribe clearly defined with characteristics
- [ ] Zag test passed (all 5 criteria)
- [ ] Implementation roadmap created

## Error Handling

- **Cannot identify onlyness**: Dig deeper, may need to narrow focus or create new category
- **Tribe too broad**: Keep narrowing until you can name specific passionate customers
- **Zag not defensible**: Strengthen through execution consistency, not just positioning
- **Name hurts differentiation**: Recommend name evaluation (see brand-naming task)

## Security Considerations

- Competitive intelligence should be gathered ethically
- Protect proprietary positioning strategy
- Limit distribution of brandscape analysis
- Secure customer tribe data

## Neumeier Principles Applied

- **"When everybody zigs, zag."** - Core methodology
- **"Different is better than better."** - Focus on differentiation, not improvement
- **"If you're not the only, you're not memorable."** - Onlyness statement is non-negotiable
- **"Brands are built by tribes, not demographics."** - Tribe focus over targeting

## Examples

### Example 1: SaaS Product Differentiation

```
Brand: DataFlow
Category: Business Intelligence

BRANDSCAPE:
- All competitors: Feature-rich, enterprise-focused, complex
- Convention: More features = more value

ZAG OPPORTUNITY:
- When they: Add features, target enterprises
- We zag: Subtract features, target small teams

ONLYNESS:
"DataFlow is the ONLY BI tool that gives small teams
enterprise insights in under 5 minutes"

ENEMY: Complexity. Analysis paralysis. IT dependencies.
```

### Example 2: Consumer Brand Differentiation

```
Brand: CleanPath
Category: Cleaning Products

BRANDSCAPE:
- All competitors: Chemical power, germ-killing, clinical imagery
- Convention: Clean = sterile, antiseptic

ZAG OPPORTUNITY:
- When they: Emphasize killing and eliminating
- We zag: Emphasize living well and nurturing

ONLYNESS:
"CleanPath is the ONLY cleaning brand that cares
for your home like you care for your family"

ENEMY: Toxic chemicals. Fear-based marketing. Cold sterility.
```

## Notes

- Zag methodology comes from Neumeier's 2006 book
- The 17 checkpoints are meant to be worked through sequentially
- Onlyness statement is the single most important output
- Differentiation must be validated with real customers
- Run this after brand-gap-analysis to ensure strategy-execution alignment
- For brand naming evaluation, use brand-naming task
- For charisma assessment, run *brand-charisma-audit
