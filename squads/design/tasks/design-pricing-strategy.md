Develop value-based pricing for design services using Chris Do's methodology.

## Metadata

## Purpose

Transform from hourly billing to value-based pricing. Stop selling time, start selling transformation.

> "Price is a story you tell yourself. If you don't believe in your value, no one will."
> -- Chris Do

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Client discovery call completed (use `*discovery-call`)
- [ ] Problem quantified in dollars
- [ ] Client transformation value estimated
- [ ] Decision maker identified

## Phase 1: Problem Diagnosis

### Quantify the Cost of the Problem

Ask these questions during discovery:

```
LEVEL 1 - SURFACE
- What brought you here today?
- What are you looking to accomplish?

LEVEL 2 - PROBLEM
- What is the REAL problem you're trying to solve?
- How long have you had this problem?
- What have you already tried?

LEVEL 3 - COST
- How much is this problem costing you? ($/month or $/year)
- What happens if you don't solve this in 6 months?
- What opportunities are you missing because of this?

LEVEL 4 - VALUE
- If I could solve this completely, what would that be worth?
- How would you measure success?
- What would change in your business?
```

### Document the Problem Cost

```
PROBLEM COST CALCULATION:

Problem: [Describe the core problem]
Duration: [How long they've had it]

Direct Costs:
- Lost revenue: $____/month
- Wasted resources: $____/month
- Missed opportunities: $____/month

Indirect Costs:
- Brand perception damage: $____
- Competitive disadvantage: $____
- Team frustration/turnover: $____

TOTAL ANNUAL COST: $______
```

## Phase 2: Value Calculation

### The Value-Based Pricing Formula

```
YOUR PRICE = Value Created × Your Share (10-20%)

Example:
- Problem costs client: $200,000/year
- Your solution captures: 25% of lost value
- Value created: $50,000/year
- Your share (20%): $10,000 - $20,000

BUT WAIT - consider multi-year impact:
- 3-year value: $150,000
- Your share (15%): $22,500
```

### Value Categories to Calculate

1. **Revenue Generated**
   - New customers acquired
   - Higher conversion rates
   - Increased average order value
   - Expanded market reach

2. **Costs Saved**
   - Operational efficiency
   - Reduced errors/rework
   - Streamlined processes
   - Lower customer acquisition cost

3. **Risks Mitigated**
   - Brand consistency
   - Legal compliance
   - Market positioning
   - Competitive protection

4. **Opportunities Unlocked**
   - New markets
   - Premium positioning
   - Strategic partnerships
   - Scalability

## Phase 3: Goldilocks Pricing (3 Options)

> "Give them options, not ultimatums. Let them choose the level of transformation."

### Structure Your Options

```
PREMIUM - $[3X] - Complete Transformation
Everything from Professional PLUS:
- [Additional strategic component]
- [Extended support/implementation]
- [VIP access or exclusivity]

PROFESSIONAL - $[2X] - Recommended ⭐
The ideal solution including:
- [Core deliverables]
- [Key strategic elements]
- [Standard support period]

ESSENTIAL - $[X] - Problem Core
Minimum viable solution:
- [Basic deliverables only]
- [Limited scope]
- [Shortest timeline]
```

### Pricing Psychology Rules

1. **Present from highest to lowest** (anchoring effect)
2. **Always recommend one option** (usually Professional)
3. **Maintain proportional gaps** (Basic: $X, Pro: $2-2.5X, Premium: $4-5X)
4. **80% will choose the middle** (design it as your ideal)
5. **After presenting, STOP TALKING** (let them process)

## Phase 4: ROI Presentation

### Build the Business Case

```
ROI CALCULATION FOR CLIENT:

Investment: $[Your Price]
Value Created: $[Annual Value]
ROI: [Value / Price] = X.Xx return

Payback Period: [Price / (Value/12)] = X months

3-Year Total Value: $[Value × 3]
Net Benefit: $[3-Year Value - Price]
```

### Presentation Script

```
"Based on what you told me, [problem] is costing you approximately
$[X] per year in [lost revenue/missed opportunities/etc].

If I can solve this and capture even [conservative %] of that value,
we're talking about $[value created] per year.

My investment of $[price] represents [%] of the value I'll create.
It pays for itself in [X] months, and you keep the benefit forever.

Does that make sense?"
```

## Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

- [ ] **Never quote hourly** - "My rate is $X/hour" commoditizes you
- [ ] **Never skip diagnosis** - Guessing price without understanding problem
- [ ] **Never give one option** - Forces yes/no instead of which one
- [ ] **Never justify with hours** - "It takes 40 hours" is irrelevant to value
- [ ] **Never accept their budget as ceiling** - Budget is starting point, not limit

## Output: Pricing Strategy Document

```markdown
# PRICING STRATEGY

**Client:** [Name]
**Project:** [Type]
**Date:** [Date]

## 1. PROBLEM DIAGNOSIS

Problem Statement:
[Clear description of the business problem]

Cost of Problem:
- Monthly: $[X]
- Annual: $[X × 12]
- 3-Year: $[X × 36]

Evidence:
[What client said that quantifies this]

## 2. VALUE CALCULATION

Transformation Value:
- Direct value: $[X]/year
- Indirect value: $[X]/year
- Total: $[X]/year

Our Share (15-20%): $[X] - $[X]

## 3. PRICING OPTIONS

| | ESSENTIAL | PROFESSIONAL ⭐ | PREMIUM |
|---|---|---|---|
| Investment | $[X] | $[2X] | $[4X] |
| [Deliverable 1] | Basic | Full | Full+ |
| [Deliverable 2] | - | Yes | Yes |
| [Deliverable 3] | - | - | Yes |
| Timeline | [X] weeks | [Y] weeks | [Z] weeks |
| Support | [X] days | [Y] days | [Z] months |

## 4. ROI SUMMARY

Recommended: PROFESSIONAL at $[2X]

ROI: [Value/Price]x
Payback: [X] months
3-Year Net Benefit: $[Value×3 - Price]

## 5. NEXT STEPS

1. Client chooses option
2. Contract signed
3. 50% deposit to start
4. Kick-off call scheduled
```

## Validation Checklist

Before presenting pricing:

- [ ] Did I diagnose before prescribing?
- [ ] Is the problem cost quantified in dollars?
- [ ] Is the transformation value calculated?
- [ ] Do I have 3 distinct options (Goldilocks)?
- [ ] Is my recommended option clear?
- [ ] Can I defend this price with confidence?
- [ ] Is the ROI compelling?

> "A $500 logo and a $50,000 logo can look identical. The difference is the problem they solve."

> "If they say yes too quickly, you didn't charge enough."

> "Your price should be a fraction of the value you create."
