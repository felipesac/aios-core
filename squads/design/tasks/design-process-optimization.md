# design-process-optimization

> Streamline design workflows and reduce friction using Dave Malouf's DesignOps Pillars framework, focusing on Workflow Operations.

## Overview

This task systematically identifies and removes friction from design processes. Following Malouf's core principle: "Operations enable creativity - we remove friction so designers can focus on design."

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of current design workflows
- Access to designers for interviews/observation
- Awareness of pain points (formal or informal)
- Stakeholder support for process changes

## Malouf Framework Reference

### Core Principle
> "Process should feel like a handrail, not a cage."

### Workflow Operations Pillar Components
1. **Process Design** - Sprints, intake, milestones, approvals
2. **Rituals** - Planning, reviews, critiques, retrospectives
3. **Handoffs** - Design to dev, research to design, QA
4. **Templates** - Briefs, specs, presentations

### Friction Categories
| Category | Examples | Impact |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Wait Time | Approval delays, stakeholder availability | Slower delivery |
| Rework | Unclear requirements, late feedback | Wasted effort |
| Context Switching | Multiple projects, unclear priorities | Reduced quality |
| Information Loss | Poor handoffs, missing documentation | Errors, confusion |
| Tool Friction | Manual tasks, poor integration | Lost time |

## Task Steps

### Phase 1: Friction Discovery

```yaml
step: 1
name: "Identify Friction Points"
methods:
  observation:
    - Shadow designers for a day
    - Attend design reviews and critiques
    - Observe handoff meetings
  interviews:
    questions:
      - "Where do you spend time that isn't designing?"
      - "What slows you down most often?"
      - "What do you wish was easier?"
      - "Where do things get lost or confused?"
      - "What repetitive tasks annoy you?"
  data_analysis:
    - Project timeline analysis (planned vs actual)
    - Revision counts per project
    - Handoff rejection rates
    - Meeting time analysis

## Common Process Optimizations

### Design Review Process
| Common Issue | Solution |
|--------------|----------|
| Too many reviewers | Define review RACI, limit to decision-makers |
| Unclear feedback | Structured feedback template |
| Multiple rounds | Combine reviews, earlier alignment |
| Scheduling delays | Fixed critique slots in calendar |

### Design Handoff Process
| Common Issue | Solution |
|--------------|----------|
| Missing specs | Handoff checklist template |
| Questions during dev | Design-dev pairing, office hours |
| Late changes | Change freeze policy |
| Asset management | Centralized, version-controlled assets |

### Project Intake Process
| Common Issue | Solution |
|--------------|----------|
| Unclear requirements | Standard brief template |
| Scope creep | Change request process |
| Priority conflicts | Centralized prioritization |
| Unrealistic timelines | Estimation framework |

## Malouf Principles Applied

- **"Operations enable creativity"** - Every change should reduce friction
- **"Process should feel like a handrail"** - Guide without constraining
- **"Where is the friction?"** - Start with pain points
- **"Measure before optimizing"** - Baseline before changes
- **"Every exception becomes a precedent"** - Design for sustainability

## Output Artifacts

1. **Friction Discovery Log** - Documented pain points
2. **Process Maps** - Current state visualizations
3. **Prioritization Matrix** - Impact vs effort analysis
4. **Solution Designs** - Detailed improvement plans
5. **Implementation Plans** - Pilot and rollout plans
6. **Results Dashboard** - Before/after metrics

## Anti-patterns to Avoid

| Anti-pattern | Why Bad | Instead |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| Big bang rollout | High risk, hard to course-correct | Pilot first |
| Process for process sake | Adds friction, not value | Start with friction |
| Over-engineering | Complex processes fail | Keep it simple |
| Ignoring feedback | Builds resentment | Iterate based on input |
| Measuring everything | Analysis paralysis | Focus on key metrics |

## Notes

> The goal is not to have the most sophisticated process. The goal is to have the simplest process that enables quality design work at scale.
