# design-tooling-audit

> Evaluate and optimize design tool stack using Dave Malouf's "Governance over Tools" principle and Three Lenses framework.

## Overview

This task provides a structured approach to auditing the design tool ecosystem. Following Malouf's principle "Governance over tools - process clarity matters more than tool selection," we first understand workflows, then evaluate tools against actual needs.

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of current design workflows
- Access to tool usage data (if available)
- List of current tools and licenses
- Budget context for tool investments

## Malouf Framework Reference

### Core Principle
> "The best tools amplify good process - they can't fix bad process."

### Tool Categories (How We Work Lens)
1. **Design Tools** - Core design work (Figma, Sketch, etc.)
2. **Prototyping Tools** - Interactive prototypes
3. **Collaboration Tools** - Communication and feedback
4. **Asset Management** - Libraries, icons, images
5. **Design-Dev Integration** - Handoff and tokens
6. **Research Tools** - User research platforms
7. **Documentation Tools** - Specs and guidelines

### Evaluation Criteria
| Criterion | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Adoption | What % of team uses it? |
| Workflow Fit | Does it match how we work? |
| Integration | Does it connect to other tools? |
| Governance | Are there clear usage guidelines? |
| Cost Efficiency | Value vs cost? |
| Scalability | Will it work as we grow? |

## Task Steps

### Phase 2: Usage Analysis

```yaml
step: 2
name: "Analyze Actual Usage"
data_to_collect:
  quantitative:
    - Active users per tool
    - Login frequency
    - Feature usage (if available)
    - Integration usage
  qualitative:
    - Designer satisfaction per tool
    - Pain points
    - Workarounds in use
    - Feature requests

survey_questions:
  - "Which tools do you use daily? Weekly? Rarely?"
  - "Which tools cause the most friction?"
  - "What workarounds do you use?"
  - "What's missing from our tool stack?"
  - "If you could change one tool, which would it be?"

## Malouf Principles Applied

- **"Governance over tools"** - Assess process clarity before tool selection
- **"The best tools amplify good process"** - Map workflows before evaluating
- **"You can't improve what you don't measure"** - Collect usage data
- **"Consistency at scale requires governance"** - Establish standards

## Output Artifacts

1. **Tool Inventory** - Complete list with costs
2. **Usage Analysis** - Adoption and satisfaction data
3. **Workflow-Tool Map** - How tools support workflows
4. **Governance Assessment** - Standards and ownership
5. **Tool Evaluations** - Scored assessments
6. **Recommendations Report** - Prioritized actions

## Common Tool Stack Anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern | Symptom | Solution |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| Tool sprawl | 5+ tools for similar function | Consolidate |
| Shelfware | Paid tools unused | Audit and sunset |
| Shadow IT | Unapproved tools in use | Governance + training |
| Missing governance | No standards or ownership | Establish governance |
| Poor integration | Manual data transfer | Invest in integration |

## Notes

> Remember: A tool audit without workflow understanding is just a spreadsheet exercise. Understand how work flows, then evaluate if tools support that flow.
