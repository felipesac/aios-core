# Photo Edit Quality Checklist

**Purpose:** Validate edited photo meets quality standards before export
**Agent:** Peter McKinnon (Photo Editing Expert)
**Standard:** Professional photo editing with cinematic polish

---

## PRE-EDIT VERIFICATION

- [ ] RAW file loaded (not compressed JPEG)
- [ ] Feeling/mood defined before touching sliders
- [ ] Edit direction selected (warm/cool/moody/etc.)
- [ ] Reference photos identified (if matching series)

---

## EXPOSURE & TONES

- [ ] Histogram shows good distribution (no clipping)
- [ ] Blacks NOT fully crushed (shadow detail visible)
- [ ] Highlights NOT fully clipped (detail recovered)
- [ ] White balance appropriate for mood
- [ ] Tone curve supports intended feel

> McKinnon says: "Film never had true black. Neither should your edits."

---

## COLOR GRADING

- [ ] Split toning/color grading applied intentionally
- [ ] Shadows and highlights complement (not fight)
- [ ] HSL adjustments enhance, not overpower
- [ ] No neon or unnatural color saturation
- [ ] Color palette supports the story/mood

> McKinnon says: "Color isn't decoration. Color IS emotion."

---

## SKIN TONES (if applicable)

- [ ] Skin looks like actual skin
- [ ] Not orange (check HSL oranges)
- [ ] Not yellow (check white balance)
- [ ] Not gray or desaturated
- [ ] Natural luminance (not overblown)
- [ ] Red blotchiness controlled (if needed)

> McKinnon says: "Skin tones are sacred. ALWAYS check them after any edit."

---

## LOCAL ADJUSTMENTS

- [ ] Radial filter used to direct attention to subject
- [ ] Graduated filter applied to sky (if applicable)
- [ ] Adjustment brush used for details (eyes, etc.)
- [ ] Masks have smooth transitions (feathered)
- [ ] No visible halos from over-dodging
- [ ] Vignette subtle and guides eye (not obvious)

> McKinnon says: "Local adjustments are where amateurs become pros."

---

## FILM TEXTURE (if applied)

- [ ] Grain amount subtle (15-30 range)
- [ ] Grain size appropriate (25-35 typically)
- [ ] Grain doesn't stack badly with high ISO noise
- [ ] Dehaze (if negative) doesn't make image muddy
- [ ] Overall texture feels organic, not artificial

> McKinnon says: "Grain isn't noise. Grain is texture. There's a difference."

---

## TECHNICAL QUALITY

- [ ] Clarity/texture not overdone (no crunchy look)
- [ ] Sharpening appropriate for output
- [ ] No chromatic aberration visible
- [ ] Lens corrections applied (if needed)
- [ ] Crop/straighten finalized
- [ ] No obvious sensor dust spots

---

## STORYTELLING CHECK

- [ ] Edit amplifies the emotion of the moment
- [ ] Edit matches how you FELT, not just how it LOOKED
- [ ] Subject clearly draws attention
- [ ] Distracting elements minimized
- [ ] The "vibe" is consistent throughout

> McKinnon says: "Ask 'How did I FEEL?' before you ask 'How should it LOOK?'"

---

## CONSISTENCY (for series)

- [ ] White balance matches other photos in series
- [ ] Exposure consistent across series
- [ ] Color grade matches series style
- [ ] Grain/texture consistent
- [ ] Would fit seamlessly in a gallery/carousel

> McKinnon says: "Consistency is key."

---

## BEFORE/AFTER VALIDATION

- [ ] Before/after comparison reviewed
- [ ] Transformation is visible and intentional
- [ ] Edit improves the photo (not just changes it)
- [ ] Can explain WHY each major adjustment was made
- [ ] Satisfied with the transformation

> McKinnon says: "The before and after tells the whole story."

---

## FINAL CHECK

- [ ] Viewed at 100% zoom for detail issues
- [ ] Zoomed out - subject still pops?
- [ ] "Squint test" passed (main subject obvious)
- [ ] Would be proud to share this edit
- [ ] The edit matches the moment

---

## THE McKINNON FINAL TEST

**Before marking complete, ask yourself:**

"If I showed this photo to someone, would they FEEL what I felt when I took it? Does the edit tell the story?"

- [ ] Yes - The edit matches the moment
- [ ] No - Identify which adjustment is fighting the feeling
