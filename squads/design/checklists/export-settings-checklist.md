## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

- [ ] NOT over-sharpening for web (causes artifacts)
- [ ] NOT under-sharpening for print (looks soft)
- [ ] NOT forgetting to resize (5000px to Instagram = compression)
- [ ] NOT stripping ALL metadata (keep copyright)
- [ ] NOT using PNG for photos (massive file sizes)
- [ ] NOT using JPEG for graphics with text (compression artifacts)

---

## EXPORT ORGANIZATION

- [ ] Naming convention consistent: `[Date]_[Description]_[Size]`
- [ ] Separate folders for each export type
- [ ] Original files preserved (never overwrite)
