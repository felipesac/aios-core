## How to Decline Politely

When a prospect isn't qualified:

### Budget Mismatch
```
"Thank you for considering me for this project. Based on what you've
shared, it sounds like my services may not be the right fit for your
current budget. I'd recommend [alternative/referral] who might be
better aligned with your needs right now."
```

### Timeline Mismatch
```
"I appreciate you thinking of me. Given my current commitments and
the timeline you need, I wouldn't be able to give this project the
attention it deserves. I'd hate to rush and deliver less than my best."
```

### Scope Mismatch
```
"This sounds like an interesting project, but it's outside my area
of specialization. You'd be better served by someone who focuses on
[specific area]. I can recommend [person/agency] if helpful."
```

### Cultural Mismatch
```
"After our conversation, I don't think I'm the right fit for this
project. I want to make sure you work with someone who's fully
aligned with what you need."
```

---

## Final Check

Before making your decision, ask yourself:

> "If this project doesn't deliver the result, would I be comfortable
> defending my price?"

> "Would I be proud to show this work in my portfolio?"

> "Will working with this client make me better at what I do?"

If the answer to any is no, reconsider.
