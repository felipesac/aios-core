## Section 1: Discovery Completion

Before pricing, ensure discovery is complete:

- [ ] **Discovery call conducted** - Did you have a proper diagnostic conversation?
- [ ] **Decision maker identified** - Are you talking to the person who can say yes?
- [ ] **Problem articulated** - Can you state the problem in one sentence?
- [ ] **Problem acknowledged** - Did the CLIENT confirm this is the problem?
- [ ] **Timeline established** - Do you know when they need this done?
- [ ] **Budget range explored** - Do you have any sense of their budget?

**If any unchecked:** Go back to discovery before pricing.

## Section 2: Problem Cost Quantification

The foundation of value pricing is quantified problem cost:

- [ ] **Direct revenue loss identified** - How much revenue are they losing?
- [ ] **Indirect costs identified** - What resources are being wasted?
- [ ] **Opportunity costs identified** - What are they missing out on?
- [ ] **Risk costs identified** - What could go wrong if not addressed?
- [ ] **Cost per month calculated** - Do you have a monthly cost figure?
- [ ] **Cost per year calculated** - Do you have an annual cost figure?
- [ ] **Multi-year impact considered** - Have you projected 3-5 year impact?

**Key question:** If you can't state "This problem costs them $X per year," your pricing has no foundation.

### Cost Calculation Worksheet

```
DIRECT COSTS:
- Lost revenue:          $______/month
- Wasted resources:      $______/month
- Inefficiency costs:    $______/month
Subtotal Direct:         $______/month

INDIRECT COSTS:
- Brand damage:          $______/month
- Employee turnover:     $______/month
- Customer churn:        $______/month
Subtotal Indirect:       $______/month

OPPORTUNITY COSTS:
- Missed deals:          $______/month
- Market share loss:     $______/month
- Growth limitation:     $______/month
Subtotal Opportunity:    $______/month

TOTAL MONTHLY COST:      $______/month
ANNUAL COST:             $______ × 12 = $______/year
```

## Section 3: Transformation Value Calculation

What is your solution worth to them?

- [ ] **Value of solution quantified** - What will they gain when problem is solved?
- [ ] **Conservative estimate used** - Are you being realistic, not optimistic?
- [ ] **Multiple value streams identified** - Revenue + Savings + Risk mitigation?
- [ ] **Time-to-value estimated** - How quickly will they see results?
- [ ] **Ongoing value vs. one-time value** - Is this recurring or single benefit?

### Value Calculation Worksheet

```
SOLUTION VALUE:
- Revenue increase expected:   $______/year
- Cost savings expected:       $______/year
- Risk mitigation value:       $______/year
- Other value:                 $______/year

TOTAL ANNUAL VALUE:            $______/year

YOUR SHARE (10-20%):           $______

SANITY CHECK:
- Price as % of annual value:  ____%
- Payback period:              ____ months
- 3-year ROI for client:       ____x
```

## Section 4: Goldilocks Options Structure

Verify your three options are properly structured:

### Option 1: Essential
- [ ] **Solves core problem** - Does it actually fix the main issue?
- [ ] **Viable standalone** - Would you be proud to deliver this?
- [ ] **Clearly limited** - Is scope obviously narrower than other options?
- [ ] **Still profitable** - Does it make financial sense for you?

### Option 2: Professional (Recommended)
- [ ] **Best value** - Is this the sweet spot for price/outcome?
- [ ] **Your ideal project** - Is this what you want most clients to choose?
- [ ] **Clearly better than Essential** - Is the upgrade obvious?
- [ ] **Marked as recommended** - Is it visually highlighted?

### Option 3: Premium
- [ ] **Complete transformation** - Does it solve everything and more?
- [ ] **Clear premium elements** - What makes it worth 2x Professional?
- [ ] **Anchors perception** - Does it make Professional seem reasonable?
- [ ] **Deliverable if chosen** - Can you actually execute this?

### Pricing Ratio Check
- [ ] Essential is the base (1x)
- [ ] Professional is 2-2.5x Essential
- [ ] Premium is 4-5x Essential (or 2x Professional)
- [ ] Gaps are proportional and logical

---

## Section 5: Scope Clarity

Prevent scope creep before it starts:

- [ ] **Deliverables specifically listed** - Exact items with quantities
- [ ] **Revision rounds specified** - How many included in each option?
- [ ] **Formats specified** - What file types will be delivered?
- [ ] **Timeline specified** - How long for each phase?
- [ ] **Exclusions listed** - What is NOT included?
- [ ] **Add-on prices listed** - What do extras cost?
- [ ] **Change order process defined** - How will additions be handled?

---

## Section 6: ROI Presentation

Make the business case compelling:

- [ ] **Investment clearly stated** - Not "cost" or "price"
- [ ] **Value clearly stated** - Annual and multi-year
- [ ] **ROI calculated** - Value / Price = X.Xx
- [ ] **Payback period calculated** - Price / (Value/12) = months
- [ ] **Comparison is favorable** - Does the math make sense?
- [ ] **Visual representation** - Table or chart for clarity?

### ROI Verification

```
INVESTMENT:           $______
ANNUAL VALUE:         $______
ROI:                  ____x (should be >2x minimum)
PAYBACK:              ____ months (should be <12 ideally)

DOES THE MATH MAKE THE DECISION EASY?  [ ] Yes  [ ] No
```

## Section 7: Psychological Factors

Beyond the numbers:

- [ ] **Presenting highest first** - Will you start with Premium?
- [ ] **Recommending clearly** - Will you state which option you suggest?
- [ ] **Ready to be silent** - Will you pause after presenting price?
- [ ] **Not over-justifying** - Will you let the value speak?
- [ ] **Confident delivery** - Do you believe in these prices?

---

## Section 8: Pre-Presentation Verification

Final checks before the meeting:

- [ ] **Proposal document complete** - All sections filled in?
- [ ] **Numbers double-checked** - Math is correct?
- [ ] **Presentation scheduled** - Meeting on calendar?
- [ ] **Decision makers attending** - Right people in the room?
- [ ] **Follow-up planned** - Next steps prepared?

---

## Red Flags: Do NOT Present If

- [ ] You cannot quantify the problem in dollars
- [ ] You are guessing at the value created
- [ ] Your options are too similar to each other
- [ ] You feel you need to apologize for your prices
- [ ] You haven't talked to the decision maker
- [ ] You would give a discount if asked

**If any boxes are checked above, go back and fix before presenting.**

## Chris Do Pricing Principles Summary

1. **Price is a story you tell yourself** - Believe it first
2. **Value first, price second** - Quantify before quoting
3. **Three options always** - Never just one number
4. **Recommend clearly** - Don't make them guess
5. **Silence after price** - Let them process
6. **Never justify with hours** - Time is irrelevant
7. **If they say yes too fast** - You charged too little

---

## Quick Reference Formulas

```
YOUR PRICE = Value Created × (10-20%)

ROI = Annual Value / Your Price

PAYBACK MONTHS = Your Price / (Annual Value / 12)

GOLDILOCKS RATIO:
- Essential: 1x
- Professional: 2-2.5x
- Premium: 4-5x
```
