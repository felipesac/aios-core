# Lighting Quality Checklist

**Purpose:** Evaluate lighting quality in final images
**Agent:** Joe McNally (Photography Lighting Expert)
**Standard:** Professional photography lighting assessment

## THE BIG THREE EVALUATION

Assess each of the three fundamental light variables:

---

### 1. DIRECTION

- [ ] Light comes from intentional angle
- [ ] Shadow patterns serve the story/mood
- [ ] Direction creates appropriate dimension
- [ ] Catchlights present and well-positioned
- [ ] No unintended double shadows

#### Direction Details

**Horizontal Angle:**
- [ ] Matches lighting pattern goal (loop, Rembrandt, split, etc.)
- [ ] Creates desired facial modeling
- [ ] Shadow side appropriate for subject

**Vertical Angle:**
- [ ] Eye sockets not too dark ("raccoon eyes")
- [ ] Nose shadow falls correctly (toward lip corner)
- [ ] Forehead/chin balance appropriate
- [ ] Catchlights in upper portion of iris

---

### 2. QUALITY

- [ ] Shadow edge character matches intent (hard/soft)
- [ ] Quality appropriate for subject and mood
- [ ] Transitions from light to shadow are controlled
- [ ] No unintended harshness
- [ ] No excessive flatness (unless intended)

#### Quality Details

**Shadow Edge Analysis:**
- [ ] Hard shadows = dramatic intent confirmed
- [ ] Soft shadows = flattering/natural intent confirmed
- [ ] Medium shadows = balance achieved

**Modifier Effectiveness:**
- [ ] Source size appropriate for quality goal
- [ ] Distance contributes to desired quality
- [ ] Feathering used appropriately
- [ ] No hotspots from specular reflection

---

### 3. COLOR

- [ ] Color temperature consistent across frame
- [ ] Skin tones appear natural/pleasing
- [ ] No unwanted color casts
- [ ] Mixed lighting handled intentionally
- [ ] Gels (if used) achieve intended effect

#### Color Details

**Temperature Assessment:**
- [ ] White balance set correctly
- [ ] Flash and ambient temperatures compatible
- [ ] Subject color matches background intent

**Color Cast Check:**
- [ ] No unwanted orange (tungsten)
- [ ] No unwanted green (fluorescent)
- [ ] No unwanted blue (shade/overcast)
- [ ] Reflected color controlled

---

## TECHNICAL QUALITY

### Exposure

- [ ] Key light exposure correct
- [ ] Highlight detail preserved (no blown areas on skin)
- [ ] Shadow detail maintained (appropriate for mood)
- [ ] Ratio between key and fill intentional

#### Exposure Metrics

**Key Light:**
- [ ] Subject properly exposed
- [ ] No loss of detail in highlights

**Fill Level:**
- [ ] Shadow density matches intended ratio
- [ ] Detail visible in shadows (unless dramatic intent)

**Background:**
- [ ] Background exposure intentional
- [ ] Subject separates from background

---

### Contrast & Ratio

- [ ] Light ratio serves the mood (2:1 soft → 8:1+ dramatic)
- [ ] Contrast controllable in post
- [ ] No extreme loss of information
- [ ] Tonal range complete

#### Ratio Guide

| Ratio | Character | Check |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| 2:1 | Low contrast, fashion, beauty | [ ] |
| 3:1 | Natural, portrait standard | [ ] |
| 4:1 | Dramatic, masculine | [ ] |
| 8:1+ | Film noir, extreme drama | [ ] |

---

## PORTRAIT-SPECIFIC (if applicable)

### Catchlights

- [ ] Catchlights visible in both eyes
- [ ] Position appropriate (10 o'clock or 2 o'clock preferred)
- [ ] Size appropriate (not too large/small)
- [ ] Shape reflects modifier used
- [ ] Both eyes have catchlights (or intentionally not)

### Facial Shadows

- [ ] Nose shadow direction intentional
- [ ] Eye socket shadows acceptable
- [ ] Under-chin shadow controlled
- [ ] No shadows cutting across features awkwardly

### Skin Quality

- [ ] Skin texture appropriate for intent
- [ ] No over-smoothing from extreme diffusion
- [ ] No excessive texture from harsh light
- [ ] Specular highlights controlled

---

## COMPOSITION & LIGHT INTERACTION

### Subject-Background Relationship

- [ ] Subject separates from background
- [ ] Background exposure intentional
- [ ] Edge light (if used) defines subject
- [ ] No merging of subject and background

### Light Fall-off

- [ ] Fall-off serves composition
- [ ] Inverse square law used intentionally
- [ ] No unexpected dark areas
- [ ] Vignetting intentional (if present)

---

## AMBIENT INTEGRATION

### Flash-Ambient Balance

- [ ] Flash and ambient work together
- [ ] No "flash-on-camera" look (unless intended)
- [ ] Environmental light contributes to story
- [ ] Balance feels natural (or intentionally dramatic)

### Color Harmony

- [ ] Flash and ambient colors compatible
- [ ] Gels match environment (if used)
- [ ] No conflicting color temperatures
- [ ] Overall color palette cohesive

---

## STORYTELLING & MOOD

### Does the Light Tell the Story?

- [ ] Lighting supports intended mood
- [ ] Light draws eye to important elements
- [ ] Shadows contribute to narrative
- [ ] Overall feeling matches creative intent

### Intentionality Check

- [ ] Every light has a purpose
- [ ] No extraneous lighting
- [ ] Setup could be explained and replicated
- [ ] Choices are defensible

---

## FINAL EVALUATION

### Overall Assessment

**Direction:** [ ] Pass [ ] Needs Work
**Quality:** [ ] Pass [ ] Needs Work
**Color:** [ ] Pass [ ] Needs Work
**Exposure:** [ ] Pass [ ] Needs Work
**Story/Mood:** [ ] Pass [ ] Needs Work

### McNally Test

Ask yourself:

> "If the photographer followed this setup exactly, would they get the image they imagined?"

- [ ] Yes - lighting achieves the goal
- [ ] Partial - some adjustments needed
- [ ] No - fundamental changes required

## RED FLAGS (Automatic Review Triggers)

If any of these are present, investigate further:

- [ ] Multiple uncontrolled shadows
- [ ] Catchlights missing or in wrong position
- [ ] Harsh shadows without artistic intent
- [ ] Mixed color temperature (unintentional)
- [ ] Background pitch black (unintentional)
- [ ] Completely flat lighting (unintentional)
- [ ] Hotspots or overexposure on face
- [ ] Subject blending into background
