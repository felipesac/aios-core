# design-team-health-checklist

> Team health indicators and warning signs for design organizations, based on Dave Malouf's Three Lenses framework and scaling principles.

## Overview

This checklist helps identify team health issues before they become critical. Use it monthly or quarterly to catch problems early, especially during periods of growth or change.

## How to Use

1. Review each section with your leadership team
2. Check items that are TRUE warnings (not aspirational)
3. Any checked warning sign requires investigation
4. Use the "What to Do" guidance for immediate action

## NOTES

> "Culture is fragile at scale - intentionality is required." - Dave Malouf

Use this checklist:
- Monthly for growing teams
- Quarterly for stable teams
- After any major change (reorg, leadership change, etc.)
- When something "feels off"

Prevention is easier than repair. Catch yellow flags before they turn red.
