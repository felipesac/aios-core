## NEUMEIER PRINCIPLES

> "When everybody zigs, zag."

> "Different is better than better."

> "If you're not the only, you're not memorable."

> "A commodity is any product or service whose only difference is price."

A brand that fails this checklist is on the path to commoditization.
A brand that passes this checklist has found its zag.
