**Purpose:** Validate brand strategy covers all Brand Gap elements
**Agent:** Marty Neumeier (Brand Strategy Pioneer)
**Standard:** Complete Brand Gap framework coverage

---

## STRATEGY DOCUMENTATION

- [ ] Mission statement documented and memorable
- [ ] Vision statement clear and inspiring
- [ ] Core values defined (3-5 maximum)
- [ ] Brand promise articulated in one sentence
- [ ] Target tribe identified (not just demographics)
- [ ] Positioning statement complete

**Gap Risk:** If strategy is unclear, execution will be inconsistent.

---

## VISUAL-VERBAL ALIGNMENT

- [ ] Visual identity matches brand personality
- [ ] Logo communicates brand essence
- [ ] Color palette supports emotional positioning
- [ ] Typography reflects brand voice
- [ ] Imagery style aligns with target tribe
- [ ] Visual and verbal elements feel unified

**Gap Risk:** Disconnect between what you look like and what you say.

---

## PROMISE VS DELIVERY

- [ ] Product/service delivers on brand promise
- [ ] Customer experience matches marketing claims
- [ ] Quality level meets stated positioning
- [ ] Support/service reflects brand values
- [ ] Pricing aligns with perceived value
- [ ] Post-purchase experience reinforces brand

**Gap Risk:** Customers feel deceived, trust erodes.

---

## INTERNAL VS EXTERNAL

- [ ] Employees understand brand purpose
- [ ] Internal culture reflects external brand
- [ ] Hiring criteria align with brand values
- [ ] Training reinforces brand behaviors
- [ ] Leadership models brand values
- [ ] Internal communications use brand voice

**Gap Risk:** Employees contradict brand promise in customer interactions.

## TOUCHPOINT CONSISTENCY

- [ ] Social media maintains brand voice
- [ ] Product packaging reflects brand
- [ ] Customer service embodies brand
- [ ] Email communications on-brand
- [ ] Physical spaces (if any) align with brand
- [ ] All touchpoints tell same story

**Gap Risk:** Fragmented experience confuses customers.

---

## DIFFERENTIATION

- [ ] Onlyness statement completed and validated
- [ ] Differentiation is meaningful, not superficial
- [ ] Competitors cannot easily copy positioning
- [ ] Tribe understands what makes brand unique
- [ ] All communications reinforce differentiation

**Gap Risk:** Brand becomes commodity, competes only on price.

---

## MEASUREMENT

- [ ] Brand awareness tracked
- [ ] Brand perception measured
- [ ] Customer satisfaction monitored
- [ ] Employee brand alignment surveyed
- [ ] Competitor positioning tracked
- [ ] Gap metrics reviewed quarterly

**Gap Risk:** Can't improve what you don't measure.

---

## BRIDGE MECHANISMS

- [ ] Brand guidelines documented and distributed
- [ ] Brand training program exists
- [ ] Cross-functional brand alignment sessions held
- [ ] Customer feedback loops established
- [ ] Brand council or steward assigned
- [ ] Regular brand audits scheduled

**Gap Risk:** Without bridges, gaps widen over time.

## FINAL VALIDATION

### The Gut-Feeling Test

- [ ] Would a customer describe the brand the same way you do?
- [ ] Would an employee tell the same brand story as marketing?
- [ ] Does the product experience match the advertisement?
- [ ] Is the brand consistent across every touchpoint?
- [ ] Would customers miss this brand if it disappeared?

## NEUMEIER PRINCIPLE

> "The brand gap is the distance between business strategy and customer experience.
> Strategy without creativity is dead. Creativity without strategy is art."

A passing score means left-brain strategy and right-brain creativity are connected.
A failing score means you're either planning without executing, or executing without planning.
