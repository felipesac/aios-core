# designops-maturity-checklist

> Comprehensive checklist for assessing DesignOps maturity using Dave Malouf's 5-level model across the Three Lenses framework.

## Overview

This checklist provides detailed criteria for each maturity level across all three lenses. Use it to assess current state, identify gaps, and track progress toward target maturity.

## How to Use

1. Go through each section and check items that are TRUE for your organization
2. Calculate the percentage of items checked per level
3. Your maturity level is the highest level where you have >80% items checked
4. Use unchecked items as improvement targets

## SCORING GUIDE

### Calculate Your Score

For each level, count checked items and calculate percentage:

| Level | Total Items | Checked | Percentage | Pass (>80%)? |
|-------|-------------|---------|------------|--------------|
| 1 | [count] | [checked] | [%] | [Y/N] |
| 2 | [count] | [checked] | [%] | [Y/N] |
| 3 | [count] | [checked] | [%] | [Y/N] |
| 4 | [count] | [checked] | [%] | [Y/N] |
| 5 | [count] | [checked] | [%] | [Y/N] |

**Your Maturity Level:** Highest level with >80% items checked

### Score by Lens

| Lens | L1 | L2 | L3 | L4 | L5 |
|------|----|----|----|----|-------|
| How We Work | [%] | [%] | [%] | [%] | [%] |
| How We Grow | [%] | [%] | [%] | [%] | [%] |
| How We Thrive | [%] | [%] | [%] | [%] | [%] |

### Gap Analysis

Unchecked items at your current target level = improvement backlog

**Priority 1 (Quick Wins):** Unchecked items that are low effort
**Priority 2 (Strategic):** Unchecked items that are high impact
**Priority 3 (Foundation):** Prerequisites for higher-level items

---

## USAGE NOTES

1. **Be honest** - Aspirational checking doesn't help
2. **Evidence-based** - Check only if you have evidence
3. **Re-assess quarterly** - Track progress over time
4. **Focus on next level** - Don't try to jump levels
5. **All lenses matter** - Balance improvement across lenses
