## Draplin Principles Throughout

```
GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR EVERY PHASE:

1. THICK LINES - Bold, confident strokes that work at any size
2. SIMPLIFY - "Remove until it hurts"
3. B&W FIRST - If it doesn't work in black and white, it doesn't work
4. COIN TEST - Must function at 16px/coin size
5. SKETCH FAST - Don't overthink, iterate quickly
6. VINTAGE-MODERN - Timeless structure, contemporary execution
7. WORK HARD - "Design is work, not magic"
8. MAKE COOL SHIT - Have fun, create something you're proud of
```

---

## Phase 1: Research & Discovery

```yaml
phase: research_discovery
duration: "2-4 hours"
gate: "Brief approved by client"
```

### 1.1 Initial Meeting/Intake

```markdown
## DISCOVERY OBJECTIVES

Understand deeply:
- [ ] What the business DOES
- [ ] Who the business SERVES
- [ ] What makes them DIFFERENT
- [ ] Where the logo will LIVE (applications)

### Questions to Ask

**CORE IDENTITY**
- "What does your business do in one sentence?"
- "What is the ONE WORD that captures your essence?"
- "Why was the business started?"
- "What makes you different from competitors?"

**AUDIENCE**
- "Describe your ideal customer."
- "Why do people choose you over alternatives?"
- "How do customers find you?"

**APPLICATIONS**
- "Where will this logo appear most often?"
- "Do you need it to work embroidered? On signs? In apps?"
- "What's the smallest it needs to work?"

**REFERENCES**
- "Show me 3 logos you love. Why do you love them?"
- "Show me 3 logos you hate. Why don't they work for you?"
- "Who are your competitors? What do their logos look like?"
```

```

### 2.3 Sketch Evaluation

```markdown
## EVALUATE SKETCHES

Review all sketches and mark:
★ = Strong direction (develop further)
? = Interesting, worth exploring
✗ = Dead end (learn from it)

### Selection Criteria
For each starred sketch, ask:
- [ ] Does it capture the essence word?
- [ ] Is it simple enough to draw in 10 seconds?
- [ ] Is it different from competitors?
- [ ] Can I see it working at coin size?
- [ ] Does it have potential for thick lines?

### Select 3-5 Directions
From starred sketches, choose:
1. Direction A: _________________
2. Direction B: _________________
3. Direction C: _________________
4. Direction D: _________________ (optional)
5. Direction E: _________________ (optional)

Document WHY each was selected.
```

### Phase 2 Gate

```
PROCEED TO PHASE 3 WHEN:
- [ ] 35+ sketches completed
- [ ] 3-5 strong directions identified
- [ ] Each direction is distinctly different
- [ ] Rationale documented for selections
```

---

## Phase 3: Digital Refinement

```yaml
phase: digital_refinement
duration: "4-8 hours"
gate: "3 concepts ready for presentation"
```

### 3.1 Vector Construction

```markdown
## BUILD IN VECTOR

For each selected direction:

### Construction Process
1. [ ] Create new artboard (standard size: 500x500px)
2. [ ] Build using geometric shapes
3. [ ] Apply thick lines philosophy
4. [ ] Work in BLACK ONLY (no color yet)
5. [ ] Refine proportions
6. [ ] Clean up paths

### Quality Standards
- [ ] No unnecessary anchor points
- [ ] Smooth curves, no jagged edges
- [ ] Stroke weight minimum 0.5pt at card size
- [ ] Consistent weight throughout
- [ ] Grid-aligned where appropriate

### Per Concept Checklist
Concept A:
- [ ] Vector built
- [ ] Paths clean
- [ ] Thick lines applied
- [ ] Proportions refined

[Repeat for B, C, D, E]
```

### 3.2 Initial Testing

```markdown
## EARLY TESTING

For each concept, before going further:

### Coin Test (Quick)
- [ ] Display at 16x16px
- [ ] Recognizable? Y/N
- [ ] If N, simplify now

### B&W Check
- [ ] Is it working in black?
- [ ] No dependency on color?
- [ ] If issues, address now

### Quick Squint Test
- [ ] Squint at arm's length
- [ ] Shape clear?
- [ ] Distinctive silhouette?
```

### 3.3 Refinement Iterations

```markdown
## REFINE EACH CONCEPT

### Iteration Loop
For each concept, cycle through:

1. Build version
2. Test at small size
3. Identify weak elements
4. Refine or remove
5. Test again
6. Repeat until solid

### Document Iterations
Keep versions to show process:
- Concept_A_v1.ai
- Concept_A_v2.ai
- Concept_A_v3.ai
- etc.

### When to Stop
A concept is "refined" when:
- [ ] Passes coin test
- [ ] Works in B&W
- [ ] Every element is necessary
- [ ] Further changes are lateral, not improvements
```

### Phase 3 Gate

```
PROCEED TO PHASE 4 WHEN:
- [ ] 3-5 concepts digitally refined
- [ ] All pass basic coin test
- [ ] All work in B&W
- [ ] Each is distinctly different
- [ ] Ready for deep simplification
```

---

## Phase 4: Simplification & Validation

```yaml
phase: simplification_validation
duration: "2-3 hours"
gate: "3 concepts pass all Draplin tests"
```

### 4.1 Deep Simplification

```markdown
## APPLY REDUCTION PROCESS

Use task: logo-simplification.md

For each concept:

### Element Inventory
- [ ] List every element
- [ ] Question each one
- [ ] Identify candidates for removal

### Removal Rounds
1. [ ] Remove all effects (should already be none)
2. [ ] Remove all decoration
3. [ ] Test without secondary text
4. [ ] Test without structural elements
5. [ ] Push to the limit

### Find the Essential Form
"What is the MINIMUM that still works?"
- [ ] Concept A essential form: _________________
- [ ] Concept B essential form: _________________
- [ ] Concept C essential form: _________________
```

### 4.2 Full Validation

```markdown
## DRAPLIN TEST BATTERY

Use checklist: logo-quality-checklist.md

For each concept, complete ALL tests:

### Concept A
- [ ] Coin Test: PASS / FAIL
- [ ] B&W Test: PASS / FAIL
- [ ] Squint Test: PASS / FAIL
- [ ] Memory Test: PASS / FAIL
- [ ] Embroidery Test: PASS / FAIL
- [ ] 10-Second Sketch Test: PASS / FAIL

ALL PASS? [ ] Yes [ ] No - If no, return to refinement

[Repeat for B, C]
```

### 4.3 Prepare Presentation Concepts

```markdown
## FINALIZE FOR PRESENTATION

- [ ] Listen to feedback without defending

### Handling Feedback

If "I love it!":
→ Great! Document what resonates.

If "Make it pop":
→ "What specifically feels like it's missing?"
→ Often means: more contrast, bolder

If "Can we combine A and B?":
→ "We can explore that. Let me explain why each works as-is first."
→ Be cautious of Frankenstein logos

If "I need to show my team":
→ "Absolutely. When can we reconvene?"
→ Try to identify the real decision-maker

If "None of these are right":
→ "Help me understand what's missing."
→ Return to brief: "Is our understanding still correct?"
```
