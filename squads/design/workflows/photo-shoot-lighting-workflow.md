## Phase 1: Concept & Planning

### Step 1.1: Define the Story
**Purpose:** Understand what the light needs to communicate

**Questions to Answer:**
- What is the purpose of this shoot?
- What emotion should the viewer feel?
- What is the narrative being told?
- Who is the subject and what do they represent?

**Actions:**
1. Interview client/review brief
2. Identify key emotional beats
3. Reference images (if available)
4. Define the "one word" that describes desired feel

**Output:**
```
STORY DEFINITION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Shoot: [Name]
Subject: [Who/What]
Purpose: [Why this image exists]
Emotion: [What viewer should feel]
One Word: [Single descriptor]
Reference: [Images or descriptions]
```

**Validation:** Clear creative direction established

---

### Step 1.2: Plan The Big Three
**Purpose:** Define Direction, Quality, and Color before touching gear

**For Each Variable:**

**DIRECTION:**
- What angle tells this story?
- Where should shadows fall?
- What patterns work for this subject?
- Options: Rembrandt, Loop, Split, Butterfly, Rim

**QUALITY:**
- Hard light = dramatic, edgy, powerful
- Soft light = gentle, flattering, approachable
- What serves the story?

**COLOR:**
- Warm = intimate, comfortable, nostalgic
- Cool = professional, distant, clinical
- What temperature supports the emotion?

**Output:**
```
THE BIG THREE PLAN
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
DIRECTION: [Angle, pattern, reasoning]
QUALITY: [Hard/Soft, reasoning]
COLOR: [Temperature, gels needed, reasoning]
```

**Validation:** All three variables defined with reasoning

---

### Step 1.3: Design Layer Structure
**Purpose:** Plan which layers are needed and why

**Layer Planning:**

| Layer | Needed? | Purpose | Notes |
|-------|---------|---------|-------|
| 0: Ambient | [ ] | [Purpose] | [Details] |
| 1: Key | [x] | [Purpose] | Always needed |
| 2: Fill | [ ] | [Purpose] | [Details] |
| 3: Separation | [ ] | [Purpose] | [Details] |
| 4: Background | [ ] | [Purpose] | [Details] |
| 5: Accent | [ ] | [Purpose] | [Details] |

**McNally Rule:** "STOP when the image works. More light ≠ better."

**Output:**
```
LAYER PLAN
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Layers needed: [List]
Key light: [Description]
Additional lights: [Only if justified]
Fill strategy: [Light/Reflector/Ambient]
```

**Validation:** Each layer has specific purpose

---

## Phase 2: Gear Selection & Preparation

### Step 2.1: Select Equipment
**Purpose:** Choose gear that serves the plan

**Based on Big Three Plan:**

**Lights:**
- Key: [Type based on power needs]
- Additional: [Only if layer plan requires]
- Backup: [Always]

**Modifiers:**
- For planned quality: [Size and type]
- Alternatives: [In case of issues]

**Gels:**
- For planned color: [Specific gels]
- Correction gels: [For ambient matching]

**Triggers:**
- Primary: [Type]
- Backup: [Type]

**Output:**
```
EQUIPMENT LIST
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
LIGHTS: [List with purpose]
MODIFIERS: [List with purpose]
GELS: [List]
TRIGGERS: [Primary + backup]
SUPPORT: [Stands, weights, clamps]
```

**Validation:** All planned layers have appropriate gear

---

### Step 2.2: Pack Using Gear Checklist
**Purpose:** Ensure nothing is forgotten

**Actions:**
1. Run through `/checklists/lighting-gear-checklist.md`
2. Check all batteries
3. Test all triggers
4. Verify modifier completeness
5. Pack backup items

**Checklist Confirmation:**
- [ ] All lights fire correctly
- [ ] Batteries charged/fresh
- [ ] Modifiers complete
- [ ] Gels present
- [ ] Backups packed
- [ ] Gaffer tape (always)

**Validation:** Checklist completed, all items accounted for

---

### Step 2.3: Create Setup Diagram
**Purpose:** Pre-visualize the setup before arriving

**Diagram Elements:**
- Camera position
- Subject position
- All light positions with modifiers
- Distances and angles
- Power setting estimates

**Output:**
```
PRE-SHOOT DIAGRAM
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

        [Light + Modifier]
        Est. Power: [X]
              ↘
                [S]


                [C]

Distances: [Estimates]
Notes: [Special considerations]
```

**Validation:** Diagram is clear enough to follow on-set

---

## Phase 3: Execution (On Location/In Studio)

### Step 3.1: Assess Ambient (Layer 0)
**Purpose:** Understand existing light before adding

**Actions:**
1. Take test shot of ambient only
2. Evaluate exposure, color, quality
3. Decide: use, suppress, or balance
4. Set base exposure for ambient

**Questions:**
- What is the ambient exposure?
- Does it help or hurt the story?
- How many stops to underexpose ambient?

**Output:**
```
AMBIENT ASSESSMENT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Exposure: ISO [X], f/[X], 1/[X]
Color: [Temperature]
Quality: [Hard/Soft]
Decision: [Use/Suppress/Balance]
Target ambient: [X] stops under/over
```

**Validation:** Ambient strategy confirmed

---

### Step 3.2: Build Key Light (Layer 1)
**Purpose:** Establish the primary light source

**McNally Process:**
1. Position light at planned angle
2. Set to estimated power
3. Take test shot (ambient suppressed)
4. Evaluate:
   - Is direction creating intended shadows?
   - Is quality appropriate?
   - Is exposure correct?
5. Adjust ONE variable at a time
6. Repeat until key light is perfect

**Key Light Checklist:**
- [ ] Direction creates intended mood
- [ ] Shadow pattern is flattering/appropriate
- [ ] Catchlights visible (portraits)
- [ ] Quality matches plan (hard/soft)
- [ ] Exposure is correct

**Critical Rule:** "Get key light perfect before adding anything else."

**Validation:** Key light works alone as viable image

---

### Step 3.3: Add Fill If Needed (Layer 2)
**Purpose:** Control shadow density

**Decision Point:**
- Is fill actually needed?
- What ratio serves the story?

**Fill Options:**
| Method | Character | When to Use |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Reflector white | Soft, neutral | Natural feel |
| Reflector silver | Punchy, specular | More fill needed |
| Second flash | Controllable | Precise ratio needed |
| Ambient | Natural | Drag shutter |

**Fill Checklist:**
- [ ] Fill is weaker than key (always)
- [ ] Ratio matches mood goal
- [ ] No competing shadows
- [ ] Fill enhances, doesn't flatten

**Validation:** Ratio established, shadows controlled

---

### Step 3.4: Add Separation If Needed (Layer 3)
**Purpose:** Separate subject from background

**Decision Point:**
- Does subject blend with background?
- Would edge definition improve the image?

**Separation Checklist:**
- [ ] Light positioned behind/beside subject
- [ ] Power creates visible but not blown edge
- [ ] Doesn't spill onto lens (flag if needed)
- [ ] Enhances three-dimensionality

**Warning:** Easy to overdo. Subtle is usually better.

**Validation:** Subject clearly separates from background

---

### Step 3.5: Address Background (Layer 4)
**Purpose:** Intentional background illumination

**Decision Point:**
- Is background too dark/bright?
- Would gradient improve composition?
- Does background compete with subject?

**Background Options:**
- Let key light fall off naturally
- Add dedicated background light
- Use gel for color separation
- Use grid for controlled spot

**Validation:** Background exposure is intentional

---

### Step 3.6: Final Test & Adjustment
**Purpose:** Verify complete setup

**Full Setup Test:**
1. Take shot with all lights firing
2. Evaluate overall balance
3. Check for unintended interactions
4. Fine-tune individual lights
5. Confirm mood matches story

**Final Check:**
- [ ] All layers work together
- [ ] Ratios are correct
- [ ] Color is consistent
- [ ] Exposure is accurate
- [ ] Story is being told

**Validation:** Complete setup achieves creative goal

---

### Step 3.7: Shoot
**Purpose:** Capture the images

**During Shooting:**
- Monitor for consistency
- Adjust for subject movement
- Watch for ambient changes
- Take safety shots at each setup

**If Issues Arise:**
- Isolate which layer is problematic
- Fix one variable at a time
- Don't panic-add more lights

---

## Phase 4: Review & Documentation

### Step 4.1: Evaluate Results
**Purpose:** Assess lighting quality in captured images

**Actions:**
1. Review images on calibrated display
2. Run through `/checklists/lighting-quality-checklist.md`
3. Note what worked and what didn't
4. Identify improvements for future

**Quality Evaluation:**
```
LIGHTING EVALUATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Direction: [ ] Excellent [ ] Good [ ] Needs Work
Quality: [ ] Excellent [ ] Good [ ] Needs Work
Color: [ ] Excellent [ ] Good [ ] Needs Work
Story: [ ] Achieved [ ] Partial [ ] Missed
```

**Validation:** Images meet quality standards

---

### Step 4.2: Document Setup
**Purpose:** Enable replication and learning

**Documentation Required:**
1. Final diagram with actual positions
2. All power settings
3. Distances (measured if possible)
4. Modifier configurations
5. Gel combinations
6. Camera settings
7. Notes on adjustments made

**Output:**
```
FINAL SETUP DOCUMENTATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[Complete diagram]

KEY LIGHT:
→ Position: [Exact]
→ Modifier: [Type]
→ Power: [Final setting]
→ Distance: [Measured]
→ Gel: [If any]

[Continue for each light]

CAMERA:
→ ISO: [Final]
→ Aperture: [Final]
→ Shutter: [Final]
→ WB: [Setting/Kelvin]

NOTES:
→ [What worked]
→ [What was adjusted]
→ [What to remember]
```

**McNally Rule:** "If you can't replicate it, you didn't really learn it."

**Validation:** Setup could be recreated from documentation

---

### Step 4.3: Capture Learnings
**Purpose:** Improve future shoots

**Learning Log:**
```
SHOOT LEARNINGS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Date: [Date]
Shoot: [Name]

WHAT WORKED:
→ [Success 1]
→ [Success 2]

WHAT DIDN'T:
→ [Issue 1] - Cause: [Why] - Fix: [Solution]
→ [Issue 2] - Cause: [Why] - Fix: [Solution]

NEXT TIME:
→ [Improvement 1]
→ [Improvement 2]

GEAR NOTES:
→ [Equipment observations]
```

**Validation:** Learnings documented for future reference

## Workflow Summary

| Phase | Steps | Key Output |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 1. Concept | Story, Big Three, Layers | Creative direction |
| 2. Prep | Gear, Checklist, Diagram | Ready to shoot |
| 3. Execute | Ambient, Key, Fill, Sep, BG, Test | Quality images |
| 4. Review | Evaluate, Document, Learn | Replicable setup |

## McNally Principles Throughout

- **Phase 1:** "What do you want the viewer to feel? Start there."
- **Phase 2:** "Always have a backup. And a backup for the backup."
- **Phase 3:** "Start with one light. Get it right before adding more."
- **Phase 4:** "If you can't diagram it, you don't truly understand it."

## Emergency Procedures

### If Nothing is Working:
1. STOP
2. Turn off all lights except key
3. Get key light perfect alone
4. Add other elements one at a time
5. Identify where it went wrong

### If Running Out of Time:
1. Simplify to one light + reflector
2. Use bounce for quick soft light
3. Embrace ambient as fill
4. Get the shot, document for later

### If Gear Fails:
1. Switch to backup immediately
2. If no backup, simplify setup
3. Bounce-only emergency approach
4. Reschedule if critical gear missing
