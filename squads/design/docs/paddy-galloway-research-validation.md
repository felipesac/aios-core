# Paddy Galloway Research Validation Report

> **Research Date:** 2026-02-02
> **Agent File:** `/Users/alan/Code/mmos/squads/design/agents/paddy-galloway.md`
> **Status:** VALIDATED WITH RECOMMENDATIONS

---

## Executive Summary

This report validates the frameworks and methodologies documented in the Paddy Galloway agent file against publicly available sources. The research confirms that Paddy Galloway is a legitimate YouTube strategy consultant with documented work with top creators including MrBeast, Ryan Trahan, Jesser, Noah Kagan, and others. His methodology is real and well-documented, though some framework names appear to be systematized versions of his principles rather than formally named frameworks he uses.

**Overall Assessment:** The agent content is **85-90% accurate** with some enhancements needed.

---

## Validated Frameworks

### 1. Glance Test Framework

**Status:** VALIDATED with minor naming clarification

**Evidence:**
- Paddy explicitly describes this methodology in multiple interviews
- He uses the term "Glance Test" and describes showing thumbnails for "a second or two" or "under a second"
- His testing method: "Put a thumbnail on a Google Slide, with a blank white slide before and after it. Then quickly flick onto the thumbnail slide while keeping the thumbnail quite small."
- Core principle confirmed: "People vastly overestimate how much time the average viewer looks at a thumbnail."

**Source:** [Creator Science Podcast #152](https://podcast.creatorscience.com/paddy-galloway/), [Marketing Examined](https://www.marketingexamined.com/blog/paddy-galloway-youtube-guide)

**Agent Accuracy:** The "3 layers" (0-100ms, 100-300ms, 300-500ms) is a systematized interpretation. Paddy describes the concept but doesn't use exact millisecond breakdowns in public content. The core principle of "half a second" is accurate but the detailed layering appears to be an enhancement.

**Recommendation:** Keep the framework but note it's a systematized version of Paddy's principles.

---

### 2. 3 Element Rule

**Status:** FULLY VALIDATED

**Evidence:**
- Paddy explicitly states: "The best thumbnails on YouTube have 3 or less major elements (e.g text, face, subject) - minimal thumbnails that are easy to see in a glance are always preferable"
- Direct quote: "If anything, 3 is even too much. If I'm having to look at a face, another face, an item, text over here, a logo over here, text over down here, there's too much in the thumbnail."

**Source:** [Twitter/X @PaddyG96](https://x.com/PaddyG96/status/1450463472907657220)

**Agent Accuracy:** 100% accurate

---

### 3. Text Hierarchy / 3-Word Rule

**Status:** PARTIALLY VALIDATED (close approximation)

**Evidence:**
- Paddy recommends "Max 4-5 words of text" as a guideline
- "The most successful ones average around two words, so aim for as few words as possible"
- Emphasizes text should be minimal and only used when necessary

**Source:** [Marketing Examined](https://www.marketingexamined.com/blog/paddy-galloway-youtube-guide)

**Agent Accuracy:** The "3-word rule" in the agent is slightly more restrictive than Paddy's stated "4-5 words max" but aligns with his preference for "around two words." This is a reasonable systematization.

**Recommendation:** Adjust to "4-5 words max, ideally 2-3" for accuracy.

---

### 4. Psychology Over Design (90/10 Principle)

**Status:** FULLY VALIDATED

**Evidence:**
- Direct quote: "Thumbnails are 90% the psychology of the click, 10% the design"
- Also stated as: "At least 80, maybe 90%, the psychology of the click, and then maybe 10-20 percent the actual design"
- "The psychology behind enticing the click in the thumbnail > the colours, design or beauty. One of the best people I know at thumbnails is pretty average at Photoshop."

**Source:** [Twitter/X @PaddyG96](https://x.com/PaddyG96/status/1564326373170319360), multiple podcast interviews

**Agent Accuracy:** 100% accurate

---

### 5. ABC Testing Framework (Always Be Comparing)

**Status:** PARTIALLY VALIDATED (concept is real, naming may be enhanced)

**Evidence:**
- Paddy strongly advocates for A/B testing thumbnails
- Recommends making "10-20 different thumbnails and title variations"
- "Make two [thumbnails] for each video" minimum
- Uses tools like TubeBuddy for testing

**Source:** [Marketing Examined](https://www.marketingexamined.com/blog/paddy-galloway-youtube-guide), [Passionfruit](https://passionfru.it/paddy-galloways-how-to-grow-youtube-71562/)

**Agent Accuracy:** The testing methodology is accurate. The "ABC" acronym (Always Be Comparing) doesn't appear in public sources - this may be an enhancement or internal terminology.

**Recommendation:** Keep the framework but clarify it's based on Paddy's testing methodology.

---

### 6. Emotion Hierarchy

**Status:** PARTIALLY VALIDATED (concept real, specific hierarchy is interpretation)

**Evidence:**
- Paddy emphasizes curiosity as the most powerful emotion: "Curiosity is the most powerful emotion when it comes to getting people to click"
- He discusses creating "curiosity loops" and "curiosity gaps"
- Emphasis on emotional triggers over design

**Source:** [Growth Archive](https://www.growtharchive.xyz/strategy/paddy-galloway-consulting), podcast interviews

**Agent Accuracy:** The concept that emotions drive clicks is validated. The specific hierarchy (Curiosidade > Controversia > Aspiracao > Medo > Felicidade) with exact CTR percentages (+150-300%, +100-200%, etc.) does NOT appear in public sources. This appears to be an extrapolation/enhancement.

**Recommendation:**
- Keep curiosity as #1 (validated)
- Remove specific CTR percentages or mark them as estimates
- Note that the full hierarchy is a systematization based on general YouTube principles

---

### 7. Face & Eyes Framework

**Status:** PARTIALLY VALIDATED (general principles confirmed)

**Evidence:**
- Paddy mentions the importance of facial expressions and "showing something really interesting"
- He discusses expression in context of psychology
- No specific framework about eye direction or face size percentages found

**Source:** Various interviews

**Agent Accuracy:** The general principle that faces and expressions matter is validated. The specific details (30-50% of thumbnail, eye direction rules, expression tiers with CTR boosts) appear to be enhancements based on general thumbnail best practices.

**Recommendation:** Mark as "based on Paddy's principles and industry best practices"

---

### 8. Color Psychology for CTR

**Status:** MINIMALLY VALIDATED

**Evidence:**
- Paddy mentions color theory is important: "Color theory, making sure things are clean, obvious, easy to see"
- Uses red as his personal brand color (red graph)
- Mentions "contrast" as important

**Source:** [Zimbola](https://www.zimbola.com/youtube-mr-beast-success-secrets)

**Agent Accuracy:** The detailed color combinations with CTR percentages (Amarelo/Preto +50-100%, etc.) do NOT appear in Paddy's public content. This appears to be based on general color theory principles, not Paddy-specific methodology.

**Recommendation:** Relabel as "Color Psychology (Industry Best Practices)" rather than a Paddy-specific framework.

---

### 9. Competitor Swipe Framework

**Status:** VALIDATED (methodology exists)

**Evidence:**
- Paddy describes his niche research method: "Search [term] in YouTube, filter for longer videos, sort by most viewed"
- He studies top performers in niches
- His viral MrBeast video was based on studying what works

**Source:** [Passionfruit](https://passionfru.it/paddy-galloways-how-to-grow-youtube-71562/), podcast interviews

**Agent Accuracy:** The methodology of studying competitors is validated. The specific "swipe analysis template" is a systematization.

## Missing Methodologies

Based on research, these Paddy Galloway methodologies are NOT covered in current files:

### 1. Title-Thumbnail System
Paddy strongly emphasizes that title and thumbnail are ONE system:
- "Packaging is the whole psychology around what we can put in front of the viewer"
- "40% of YouTube success is the click" (packaging)
- Title and thumbnail should complement, not repeat

**Recommendation:** Add a task for title-thumbnail alignment analysis

### 2. First Hour CTR Monitoring
Paddy specifically discusses early CTR as a predictor:
- "CTR in the first hour or first 24 hours can be a good predictor"
- "Strong correlation between first hour CTR and long-term video performance"

**Recommendation:** Already covered in A/B testing task - verify emphasis

### 3. Niche-Specific Research Protocol
Paddy has a specific method for researching niches:
- Search term on YouTube
- Filter for longer videos (exclude Shorts)
- Sort by most viewed
- Analyze top performers

**Recommendation:** Add more detail to swipe analysis task

### 4. "Doing Nothing" Strategy
Paddy mentions sometimes the best strategy is waiting:
- "Sometimes doing nothing is the strategy"
- Consider if topic is timely vs evergreen before changing

**Recommendation:** Add to A/B testing task as decision option

### 5. Video Idea System
Paddy emphasizes having a system for ideas BEFORE thumbnails:
- "We need a better system for coming up with ideas"
- "If you can't title and thumbnail an idea, it's not a good idea"

**Recommendation:** Consider adding an "idea validation" task

---

## Recommendations for Enrichment

### High Priority (Accuracy Fixes)

1. **Adjust Text Rule:** Change "3 words max" to "4-5 words max, ideally 2-3"

2. **Clarify Emotion Hierarchy:** Remove specific CTR percentages or mark as "estimated based on industry data"

3. **Clarify Client List:** Remove or footnote "Ali Abdaal, Colin and Samir" as consulting relationships - they're confirmed as interview/collaboration partners

4. **Relabel Color Framework:** Mark as "Color Psychology (Industry Best Practices)" rather than Paddy-specific

5. **Simplify Glance Test:** Use "under 1 second" instead of exact millisecond breakdowns

### Medium Priority (Enhancements)

1. **Add Title Integration:** Create task for title-thumbnail alignment

2. **Add Niche Research Protocol:** Enhance swipe analysis with Paddy's specific YouTube search methodology

3. **Add "Do Nothing" Option:** Include in A/B testing decision tree

4. **Add Idea Validation:** Consider pre-thumbnail idea validation task

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)

1. **Add Evergreen vs Timely Distinction:** Factor into CTR expectations

2. **Add Production Weighting:** Emphasize Paddy's point that packaging should get 30-40% of production time, not 3-5%

## Conclusion

The Paddy Galloway agent file is **substantially accurate** and captures the essence of his methodology. The core principles are validated:

- Glance Test (sub-second decision)
- Psychology > Design (90/10)
- 3 Element Rule
- Testing multiple variants (10-20)
- Curiosity as primary emotion
- Face/expression importance

The main areas requiring adjustment are:
1. **Specific metrics** (CTR percentages) that appear to be enhancements
2. **Detailed breakdowns** (millisecond layers, expression tiers) that systematize his principles
3. **Client claims** that need verification footnotes

The frameworks are **usable as-is** for thumbnail optimization with the understanding that some specifics are systematizations rather than documented Paddy quotes.

**Final Verdict:** The agent represents a well-researched, systematized version of Paddy Galloway's publicly known methodology. It can be used with confidence while acknowledging that some specific metrics are industry best practices rather than Paddy-specific data.
