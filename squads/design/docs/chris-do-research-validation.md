## Part 2: Missing Frameworks to Add

### 1. The Socratic Six

**Status:** MISSING - SHOULD BE ADDED

**Sources:**
- [The Futur Academy - The Socratic Six Introduction](https://academy.thefutur.com/courses/351170/lectures/23123633)
- [How to Negotiate Course](https://www.thefutur.com/course/how-to-negotiate)
- [How to Deal with Objections](https://www.thefutur.com/content/how-to-deal-with-objections)

**Details:**
The Socratic Six is Chris Do's signature sales technique - a conversational framework built on 20+ years of experience. Key components include:

- **The Raging Bull** - Handling aggressive clients with empathy
- **The Double Down** - Agreeing with price objections to reframe
- **Question-based responses** - Reframing objections through questions
- Named after Socrates - asking strategic questions rather than telling

This is a MAJOR framework that should be added to the agent's operational frameworks.

---

### 2. The Perfect Proposal Structure

**Status:** MISSING - SHOULD BE ADDED

**Sources:**
- [The Futur - The Perfect Proposal Course](https://www.thefutur.com/course/perfect-proposal)

**Details:**
Chris Do has a complete course and guidebook on proposals that includes:
- Real proposal templates (InDesign and Keynote)
- Copy-and-paste deliverable descriptions
- Single-page proposal templates
- 200+ pages of content from 10+ years experience
- Capabilities Deck bonus

The current `design-proposal-creation.md` task covers proposal structure but could be enriched with specific details from this course.

---

### 3. Positioning and Marketing Framework

**Status:** MISSING - SHOULD BE ADDED

**Sources:**
- [The Futur - Positioning & Marketing Course](https://www.thefutur.com/course/positioning-marketing)

- Strategic positioning as first building block of branding
- Repositioning examples (Blind went from motion design studio to brand strategy consultancy)
- "Put your business in front of the right people, in the right place, at the right time"

The current `design-business-positioning.md` is good but could be enriched with specific Futur course content.
