|--------|--------|------------|
| **ROI Importance** | VALIDATED | 100% |
| **Specific Formulas** | PARTIALLY VALIDATED | 70% |

**Agent Claims:**
- ROI calculation for design systems

**Evidence:**
> "With a nascent-yet-tangible design system in place, you can have more meaningful conversations with the people who control money, scheduling, and resources. You can discuss exactly how the design system helped save time and money."

**Note:** Brad Frost links to and endorses ROI calculators but the specific formulas and dollar amounts in the agent appear to be **industry-derived enhancements** rather than direct Brad Frost quotes.

**Verdict:** ROI concept is validated; specific numbers are **agent enhancements**.

---

## Frameworks Partially Validated

### 8. 4-Phase Migration Strategy

| Aspect | Status | Confidence |
|--------|--------|------------|
| **Phased Approach** | PARTIALLY VALIDATED | 60% |
| **Specific 4 Phases** | NOT FOUND | 0% |

**Agent Claims:**
- 4-phase migration plan
- foundation → high-impact → long-tail → enforcement

**Research Findings:**
No public sources specifically attribute a "4-phase migration strategy" to Brad Frost. However, Brad Frost does advocate for:
- Avoiding big-bang redesigns
- Grassroots adoption
- Phased rollout approaches
- Gradual governance establishment

**Sources Consulted:**
- [Atomic Design Book - All Chapters](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/)
- [Brad Frost Blog - Design Systems tag](https://bradfrost.com/blog/tag/design-systems/)

**Verdict:** The phased approach aligns with Brad's philosophy, but the specific "4-phase" terminology and structure appear to be an **agent-specific implementation**.

---

### 9. "Shock Therapy" / Visual Shock Reports

| Aspect | Status | Confidence |
|--------|--------|------------|
| **Interface Inventory Impact** | VALIDATED | 85% |
| **"Shock Therapy" Term** | NOT FOUND | 0% |

**Agent Claims:**
- "VISUAL SHOCK THERAPY: Generate reports that make stakeholders say 'oh god what have we done'"
- Shock reports showing UI chaos

**Research Findings:**
Brad Frost describes the interface inventory's emotional impact but does not use the term "shock therapy." His description:
> "I expected it to be bad, but it was shocking to see it all laid out like that."

**Verdict:** The concept is **valid** and aligned with Brad's approach, but "Shock Therapy" branding is an **agent customization**.

---

## Frameworks Not Requiring External Validation

The following are implementation details specific to this agent that extend Brad Frost's principles:

| Feature | Type | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| YOLO Mode | Agent Enhancement | Parallel execution feature |

## Corrections Recommended

### Minor Corrections

1. **"4-phase migration"** - Consider rephrasing to "phased migration strategy" without claiming specific authorship from Brad Frost

2. **"Shock Therapy"** - Consider clarifying this as "inspired by Brad Frost's interface inventory impact" rather than a direct Brad Frost term

3. **Specific ROI numbers** - Add disclaimer that specific dollar amounts are industry estimates, not Brad Frost quotes

### No Corrections Needed

- Atomic Design (5 stages)
- Pattern Lab attribution
- Interface Inventory methodology
- Design Tokens expertise
- Governance principles
- Accessibility focus
