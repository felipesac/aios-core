## Executive Summary

The Dave Malouf agent file contains **mostly accurate** information with some important nuances and corrections needed. The core frameworks (Three Lenses, Maturity Model) are **validated as real** but with different terminology than what Dave Malouf originally documented. Some frameworks appear to be **synthesized from industry best practices** rather than explicitly attributed to Malouf.

### Overall Assessment: 7.5/10

| Category | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Three Lenses Framework | PARTIALLY VALIDATED - Real but different terminology |
| Maturity Model (5 Levels) | VALIDATED - Aligns with industry models |
| Team Topology | INDUSTRY STANDARD - Not uniquely Malouf's |
| Metrics Stack | VALIDATED - Documented in his work |
| DesignOps Pillars | SYNTHESIZED - Industry composite |
| Scaling Phases | VALIDATED - Common in his talks |

## Validated Frameworks

### 1. Three Lenses of DesignOps

**Status:** PARTIALLY VALIDATED - Terminology differs

**What the agent file says:**
- "How We Work" (workflow, tools, processes)
- "How We Grow" (skills, careers, development)
- "How We Thrive" (culture, community, well-being)

**What research found:**

Dave Malouf's Three Lenses are documented differently in his original Medium article ["The different lenses of Design Operations"](https://medium.com/amplify-design/the-different-lenses-of-design-operations-c29086cf907f). His three lenses are:

1. **Product Design Lifecycle Management (Program Management)** - Focus on workflow and activity streams, "How can I make my team more successful at getting work done?"

2. **Community Manager** - Practice managers focused on coalescing design practice across embedded designers; people operations focus

3. **Business Operational** - Chief of Staff type role supporting design leadership; most holistic lens

**Important:** The "How We Work, How We Grow, How We Thrive" terminology is actually from the **Nielsen Norman Group DesignOps Framework**, not Dave Malouf:
- "How we work together" - team organization and collaboration
- "How we get our work done" - processes and quality
- "How our work creates impact" - measurement and sharing

**Correction Needed:** The agent conflates NN/g terminology with Malouf's original framework. Consider either:
- Crediting NN/g for the Work/Grow/Thrive terminology
- Using Malouf's original lens names (Program Management, Community Manager, Business Operational)

- [DesignOps 101 - NN/g](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-operations-101/)

---

### 2. DesignOps Maturity Model (5 Levels)

**Status:** VALIDATED - Aligns with documented models

**What the agent file says:**
- Level 1: Ad Hoc
- Level 2: Emerging
- Level 3: Defined
- Level 4: Managed
- Level 5: Optimized

**What research found:**

Malouf's O'Reilly book ["What Is DesignOps?"](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/what-is-designops/9781492083023/) explicitly includes a chapter on "DesignOps Maturity Models." The 5-level maturity model is a common framework in operations disciplines (CMM, DevOps maturity, etc.) and the terminology used aligns with industry standards.

The [Nielsen Norman Group research](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/designops-maturity-low/) validates the concept of DesignOps maturity levels and found:
- Only 10% of respondents at Level 4 or 5
- Majority at Levels 2 and 3
- 20% have dedicated DesignOps roles

**Validation:** The 5-level maturity model (Ad Hoc, Emerging, Defined, Managed, Optimized) is consistent with industry standards and Malouf's documented work.

**Sources:**
- [What Is DesignOps? - O'Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/what-is-designops/9781492083023/)
- [DesignOps Maturity: Low in Most Organizations - NN/g](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/designops-maturity-low/)

---

### 3. Metrics Stack (Output, Outcome, Impact)

**Status:** VALIDATED - Explicitly documented

**What the agent file says:**
- Output Metrics (what the team produces - activity and deliverables)
- Outcome Metrics (what the team achieves - quality and effectiveness)
- Impact Metrics (business value created - strategic contribution)

**What research found:**

Dave Malouf has extensive documented work on DesignOps metrics:
- [Measuring DesignOps - Medium](https://medium.com/amplify-design/measuring-designops-d9d922c9cfbe)
- [Measuring & Evaluating Your DesignOps Practice - SlideShare](https://www.slideshare.net/dmalouf/measuring-evaluating-your-designops-practice)
- [Valuing Design & DesignOps Practice - SlideShare](https://www.slideshare.net/dmalouf/valuing-design-designops-practice)

Key validated concepts:
- "Vital Signs" - top 3-5 metrics that indicate health
- Warning against "Vanity Metrics"
- Cascading use of data: Metric -> Correlation -> Interpretation -> Threshold -> Trend -> Milestone
- Focus on "success assessment" over ROI
- Warning: "Outputs valued over outcomes" as anti-pattern

His O'Reilly book includes chapter: "A Metrics Stack"

**Validation:** The Output/Outcome/Impact framework is validated and well-documented in Malouf's work.

**Sources:**
- [Measuring DesignOps - Medium](https://medium.com/amplify-design/measuring-designops-d9d922c9cfbe)
- [Assessing Your Current DesignOps Practice - SlideShare](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/assessing-your-current-designops-practice-a-heuristic-model-dave-malouf/141118185)

---

### 4. Team Topology (Centralized, Embedded, Federated, Hybrid)

**Status:** INDUSTRY STANDARD - Not uniquely Malouf's

**What research found:**

Team topology models (Centralized, Embedded, Federated, Hybrid) are **industry-wide frameworks** used across design, data, and engineering organizations. Key sources:

- [Team Models for Scaling a Design System - Nathan Curtis/EightShapes](https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/team-models-for-scaling-a-design-system-2cf9d03be6a0)
- [Design Team Structures - Superside](https://www.superside.com/blog/design-team)
- [Design System Governance Models - UX Planet](https://uxplanet.org/design-system-governance-models-f66a97367ad5)

The Salesforce team describes a "Cyclical" model combining Centralized + Federated.

**Assessment:** While Malouf certainly discusses these topologies, they are not his original creation. Attribution should be to "Industry Best Practices" rather than specifically to Malouf.

**Recommendation:** Update agent to say "Dave Malouf / Industry Best Practices" (which it correctly does) but clarify this is a synthesis, not original framework.

---

### 5. Scaling Phases (0-5, 5-15, 15-50, 50-150, 150+)

**Status:** VALIDATED - Consistent with his talks

**What research found:**

The scaling phases concept is consistent with Malouf's documented approach to design team growth. His principle "Scale through systems, not just headcount" is well-documented.

Key principles validated:
- "Document before you scale - tribal knowledge doesn't scale"
- "Culture is fragile at scale"
- "Build the system before hiring"
- "Hire one level ahead"

---

## Incorrect or Unverified Claims

### 1. "DesignOps Assembly Co-founder"

**Status:** NOT VERIFIED

**What the agent file says:**
- "Co-fundou DesignOps Assembly"

**What research found:**

I could not find verification that Dave Malouf co-founded an organization called "DesignOps Assembly." What IS documented:
- He is a **programming committee member** for the **DesignOps Summit** (Rosenfeld Media)
- He is a **founder/co-founder of IxDA** (Interaction Design Association)
- He is a **co-founder of Enterprise UX conference**

The term "DesignOps Assembly" may be a confusion with DesignOps Summit or a community group, but I found no evidence of a formal organization with this name that Malouf co-founded.

**Correction Needed:** Remove or verify the "DesignOps Assembly Co-founder" claim. Update to accurate affiliations:
- Programming committee for DesignOps Summit
- Founder of IxDA (Interaction Design Association)
- Co-founder of Enterprise UX conference

---

### 2. "DesignOps Pillars" (5 Pillars Framework)

**Status:** SYNTHESIZED - Not uniquely Malouf's

**What the agent file says:**
Five pillars: Workflow Operations, Governance, Tools & Technology, Growth & Development, Community & Culture

**What research found:**

This appears to be a synthesis of multiple DesignOps frameworks rather than a specific Malouf framework. It's a reasonable organizational structure but I found no source attributing these specific "5 Pillars" to Dave Malouf.

**Recommendation:** Either remove specific attribution to Malouf or label as "Synthesized from Industry Best Practices"

---

### 3. "Projects, Process, People" Framework

**Status:** REFERENCED BUT NOT DETAILED

**What research found:**

The O'Reilly book description mentions "frameworks including the DesignOps Canvas and Projects, Process, People" but I could not find detailed documentation of a specific PPP framework from Malouf. The NN/g framework uses "People, Processes, and Craft."

**Recommendation:** This needs verification or removal from the agent if claimed as a major framework.

---

## Missing Methodologies

### 1. DesignOps Canvas

**Status:** SHOULD BE ADDED

The DesignOps Canvas is a visual planning tool documented by XPLANE and referenced in Malouf's work. It helps map:
- Who we are (stakeholders)
- What we do (value propositions)
- What constrains us

The canvas process can take 15 minutes to 2 days depending on depth.

**Sources:**
- [Design Ops Canvas - XPLANE](https://xplane.com/worksheet/design-ops/)
- [Design Ops Canvas - Mural Template](https://www.mural.co/templates/design-ops-canvas)

---

### 2. IxDA Founding and Community Building

**Status:** SHOULD BE MENTIONED

Dave Malouf is one of the **primary founders** of the Interaction Design Association (IxDA) and served as its first Vice President. He has been a global representative for 15+ years. This is a significant part of his design community legacy that informs his DesignOps community-building philosophy.

- [Dave Malouf - Interaction17 - IxDA](https://interaction17.ixda.org/speaker/dave-malouf/index.html)
- [Dave Malouf - Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/user/dave-malouf)

---

### 3. Assessment Package / Heuristic Model

**Status:** SHOULD BE ADDED

Malouf has published a "Design & Research Operations Assessment Package" on Medium that provides structured assessment methodology.

**Source:**
- [Design & Research Operations Assessment Package - Medium](https://medium.com/@daveixd/design-operations-assessment-package-1aea3350bcf7)

---

### 4. "Vital Signs" Concept

**Status:** SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED

Beyond general metrics, Malouf specifically promotes the concept of "Vital Signs" - the top 3-5 metrics that tell you something might be wrong. Examples include:
- Number of UX stories not deployed
- Attrition rate vs org average
- Time spent designing/researching

This should be more prominent in the metrics task.

---

### 5. DesignOps Summit Involvement

**Status:** SHOULD BE ADDED

Malouf is part of the **programming committee** for Rosenfeld Media's DesignOps Summit, one of the premier conferences in the field. He has presented at multiple summits (2018, 2023, 2024).

**Sources:**
- [Dave Malouf - DesignOps Summit 2023](https://rosenfeldmedia.com/designopssummit2023/people/dave-malouf/)

## Conclusion

The Dave Malouf agent and supporting files are **substantially accurate** and represent a solid foundation for DesignOps guidance. The main issues are:

1. **Attribution confusion** between Malouf's original Three Lenses and NN/g's Work/Grow/Thrive framework
2. **One unverified claim** (DesignOps Assembly co-founder)
3. **Missing tools** (DesignOps Canvas, Vital Signs emphasis)

The frameworks themselves are practical, well-structured, and aligned with industry best practices. With the corrections noted above, the agent would be highly accurate.
