          Specific patterns for CodeRabbit to validate based on story type:

          **Database Stories**:
          - Service filters: .eq('service', 'ttcx') on all queries
          - Schema compliance: Foreign keys, indexes, constraints
          - RLS policies: Row-level security properly configured

          - Error handling: Try-catch blocks, proper error responses
          - Security: Input validation, authentication, authorization
          - Validation: Request/response schema validation

          **Frontend Stories**:
          - Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (semantic HTML, ARIA, keyboard nav)
          - Performance: Component optimization, lazy loading
          - Responsive design: Mobile-first, breakpoints

          **Deployment Stories**:
          - CI/CD: Pipeline configuration, test coverage
          - Secrets management: No hardcoded credentials
          - Environment config: Proper variable usage

          **Security Stories**:
          - OWASP Top 10: Injection, XSS, authentication
          - Timing attacks: Constant-time comparisons
          - Data protection: Encryption, sanitization
